Elise,Hi! (giggling) Hi!
Elise,Oh my gosh... you guys are too much!
Elise,"Wow, this fire is so bright and beautiful. I can't stop looking at it. Woah."
Elise,It's like it's spinning within me.
Elise,"Oh shit, that's outsi... outside of me. Okay. Yes. I'm good!"
Priest,"Princess, you had a That's So Raven vision once more."
Elise,"Oh no, I just day-dreamed. I'm here—for the people."
Priest,"Alright, well, let's get litty in this bitch. (Hayley laughs) Light that bitch up right now."
Elise,"I will light this bitch up, right now."
Priest,"Thank you, Princess. We're gonna get higher than a kite tonight!"
Elise,"It's lit, fam."
Chase,"Oh man, I hope somebody fucks up the fireworks."
Elise,Thanks guys~ Ah!
Robots,We are the robots! Please freeze. There's too much weight. Please freeze! Please freeze!
Robot,Am I doing this right? It's my first day on the job. Please freeze. Hello.
Eggman,"(ugly chuckles) Why, hello there, young princess. Do you like my outfit, my four nipples? (gestures to his outfit) Now — you must acquire me by getting on this boat right now! Not the boat— my ship!"
Eggman,"Gimme this— (gasps) You have the Chaos Emerald! In your hands! Gimme that shit right now, or I'm gonna rip it off you my goddamn self; give it to me!"
Elise,"Uh, how about no? Hehe."
Eggman,Oh. You'd rather do this the hard way.
Eggman,"Well, then it looks like we're gonna- Wait, those aren't tornadoes, this isn't Arizona! What's happening?!"
Sonic,My! That's a pretty snazzy performance there.
Silver,Eh?!
Sonic,HmMMmMm.
Eggman,Get that goddamn hedgehog!
Sonic,Hyah! I'm going down!
Robot,"Oh my God, he's an acrobat!"
Sonic,I'm gonna kill all of you! And... poke!
Robot,(anguished robot scream)
Sonic,"Oh, don't fall!"
Sonic,"HAHA, HA! ONE!"
Sonic,"Come on, Elise."
Eggman,"Sonic, where do you think you're going you motherfucking-- Oh! He's cockblocking me! Get him!"
Sonic,You're never gonna get me~!
Sonic,"Don't worry, Eggman's an egghead."
Eggman,What did you call me?!
Silver,"Oh, I should... uh... I-I guess he's got it handled. I'll just... I mean it'd be really awkward if I walked in now, so... (cast's wheezing laughter)"
Sonic,"Are you okay, princess? Whoa!"
Robots,"Kill em', we gotta kill em'. Stop!"
Sonic,"No, you can't kill anybody. Especially not me!"
Robot,"Oh my god, I have a family."
Robots,No! Ouch.
Sonic,Huh?! It sounds like you're getting taken away!
Eggman,"Yes, Sonic, I got 'cha bitch!"
Eggman,I got her in the palm of my hands!
Sonic,"Put her down, Eggman!"
Eggman,You put yourself down. I'm taking her and the Chaos Emeralds.
Elise,Take it!
Elise,Houee!
Sonic,"I'm gonna drop it, Elise, no! Oh, thank God. Okay, I'll rescue you. Don't worry."
Eggman,"No, you won't."
Sonic,I will!
Elise,"Take it, be good."
Eggman,"I'm taking her back to my ship and you'll never see her again, Sonic. You'll be dead. 10,000 years, Sonic! (screaming louder, but farther away) 10,000 years!"
Sonic,You won't even live for then— () ten thousand years.
Eggman,Then thousand years!
Sonic,Said the— Don't make fun of me!
Eggman,"Wow, Sonic, go read a book or something. See ya, idiot."
Sonic,"I can read very well, actually."
Sonic,"No! (grunts) Well, that smarts."
Eggman,Dumbass.
Shadow,HU-gh.
Shadow,"Dang robots— always taking my job of being bland. How'd I blow you up? How'd I blow YOU up? Ugh, I have some powers I need to kind of adjust to. Anyway— oh crap, light! Hey. Wristband. Tell me my future."
Wristband,It's me. The GUN soldier that's talking to you. Your future is: Undetermined.
Shadow,"Well, that's pretty lame. I spent like $20 on you. Anyway, I'm gonna break into— WHOA!"
Shadow,"Well, that was weird. Dematerializing, rematerializing. Anyway, Rouge, that's a nice purple you have there."
Rouge,"Thanks, it's uh, a good color on me. What do you think of my scepter?"
Shadow,I think it's nice. That's the purple I was referring to.
Rouge,Oh.
Shadow,"I mean, it matches your pink."
Rouge,Gotcha.
Shadow,Good.
Rouge,What's happening?
Shadow,"It's an earthquake, Rouge. Like, honestly, didn't you learn about this in third grade?"
Robot,You're getting fucked.
Rouge,"Uh, I don't know what earthquakes are."
Shadow,(scoffs) Then you're gonna be no use against these earthquake robots.
Sonic,"Oh, hey Tails!"
Tails,Hey Sonic!
Sonic,Long time no see.
Tails,How's it goin'? You want to go get some ice cream?
Sonic,(distracted) Well...
Tails,I'm-- I'm really hungry for some ice cream. I could go for a sundae or something right now.
Sonic,Hmmm...
Tails,"I don't know, maybe... something with sprinkles."
Sonic,"I'll take one scoop, please!"
Tails,"Okay! Bye Sonic! I— Oh, okay. I can fly? What?"
Sonic,"Aw, missed him again. We always miss the ice cream airship, Tails!"
Tails,Aw man!
Tails,It dropped a feather. I didn't think airplanes had feathers.
Sonic,"What is this one, vanilla?"
Tails,I guess so. Bye!
Sonic,"Yummy, yummy in my tummy!"
Shadow,"Oh crap. Rays. Well, fortunately we made here to the computer room. Hey— hey Rouge. Hey Rouge, hey Rouge."
Rouge,Yeah.
Shadow,We found— we— we found the computer room.
Rouge,"Oh fuck, the computer room. We could play so much Fortnite in here, dude."
Shadow,Are you kidding?
Rouge,Just think of all the Fortnite battles we could win in this room with this much technology. We'd be unstoppable.
Shadow,That's lame. Listen.
Shadow,"I appreciate the effort, but the new rage is Doki Doki Literature Club battle royale."
Rouge,Ohhh. I never heard about that one. Ohhh. I never heard about that one.
Shadow,"That's the new Monika re-design. She's like a redhead... even though she was, like, kinda brunette? I don't know. I didn't play Doki Doki."
Rouge,"I've not heard about that one yet, what's it about? How does it work? It sounds like a fun game. But, I mean, my favorite game is-is Fortnite, obviously. And this is a Fortnite update. This is a DLC I purchased. It's like an Amiibo."
Shadow,I'm so proud of you.
Rouge,Thank you! We're gonna go there.
Rouge,That's where we should— that's the island we should drop on right there.
Shadow,"So, this is the fabled Tilted Towers."
Shadow,"I could make a joke about that being the Battle Bus, but— (gasp)! It's you!"
Eggman,"(sinister laughter) I know where we're droppin' today, boys. (snickers)"
Rouge,"Eggman, how did you get here?"
Eggman,How do you think I get here? I floated down on my giant Battle Bus. (Mumbles and sings) The big air bus is comin! (normal speech) You know what I'm sayin'? It's Fortnite. How could you not know about Fortnite? You said you played. You were BatFucker69 on there.
Shadow,I haven't seen you since... The Incident.
Robots,BatFucker. BatFucker. BatFucker. BatFucker.
Eggman,"We don't talk about The Incident, Shadow. Now, DIE!"
Robot,I'll destroy you BatFucker!
Shadow,"Oh, Christ!"
Robot,It's been determined!
Rouge,AAaaaa!
Rouge,That's so mean!
Shadow,That's what you get for unironically having '69' in your name.
Shadow,HOH! Teriaaa!
Rouge,"Oh Shadow, you saved me!"
Eggman,"AHA! No, god! (finishes sentence while chuckling)"
Shadow,"Oh crap, the Purple's falling in a very long time!"
Rouge,No! Gimme the— get the purple! Oh no!
Robots,(repeatedly) Ow. Ow. Ow.
Robots,[unintellegable]
Robot,Instant ramen!
Shadow,So it's the power of Purple. I don't want to touch it.
Rouge,Did he break it?
Shadow,I don't kno— OH GOD
Memphis,(visceral screaming)
Rouge,Oh my god!
Eggman,"Oh no, the instant ramen's been released! We need to go, NOW."
Rouge,"Nooo, my Amiibo...."
Shadow,"A shadow. I feel like I should be able to feel with this guy, but.... I don't know. Something about it— AUGH!"
Shadow,"Going through the floor. Who do you think you are, Danny Phantom or something?"
Rouge,(gasps)
Shadow,My shadow... That's how I got my name!
Memphis,"(menacing laughter, followed by violent coughing)"
Shadow,"Oh d— dude, you alright?"
Memphis,(more violent coughing)
Shadow,You good? Good? You need a lozenge?
Rouge,"Oh my god, who the fuck is that?"
Shadow,Just let him have— just give him a second to clear his throat.
Memphis,(menacing laughter)
Memphis,Welcome to Tilted Towers.
Memphis,"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Memphis, Tennessee, and I'm part lizard. Nice to— Yoroshiku egai-ishima, as they say in Nippon."
Shadow,Mee-Philes! I should've guessed. What happened to your mouth?
Memphis,"Oh, Shadow the Hedgehog, you don't know? There's a new trend going around online called kinning.My body is reforming to suit your own.oon I will be 100% Shadow, and there's nothing you can do to stop me. (villainous laughter)"
Shadow,"I can, um, kick your ass. Right now."
Memphis,"(Minecraft zombie growl) Let me get a good smell of you, little boy. (deep congested breathing)"
Shadow,No. Okay. You have to... gonna have to back up.
Memphis,"(snort laughs) Look at this orb. Inside you'll see the future. In your future, it looks like you'll kiss seven girls. How lucky for you. I learned this a few minutes ago."
Shadow,"Joke's on you! If you were a true copy of me, you'd know I'm gay."
Memphis,"Here, come to my house. C'mon, let's just go."
Rouge,Wha--!
Memphis,To my house.
Alfred,This game is AWFUL.
Blue,We just got fucking Thanos'd. What the shit?
Ryan,We just disappeared!
Silver,"Okay, so.."
Silver,Google Maps said the Denny's would be just around this corner. Denny's?
Silver,Augh! Get out.. of my way please!
Silver,Thank you!
Blaze,Silver!
Silver,Huh?
Blaze,Silver! The Denny's is that way.
Silver,"Finally, a Grand Slam!"
Silver,Let's go!
Blaze,"Save a cheese melt for me, Silver!"
Blaze,There it is: the Grand Slam! The Grandest Slam of them all -
Grand Slam,"It is I, the Grand Slam!"
Silver,I'm gonna savor every morsel of this. Let's go!
Grand Slam,You will not consume me. I will have both of your souls ingested in the G R A N D S L A M !
Blaze,...and then we ate it.
Silver,I can't believe we ate the who~ole thi~ng…
Blaze,"I know, I'm stuffed. I could use a nap, Silver."
Silver,"Well, I just always want to sleep, you know. I'm tired all the time. I hate it. 'Cause then when I try to go to sleep, I--I can't."
Blaze,"I know, and you angst so much about it."
Silver,"Ugh, I just wanna sleep, Blaze. I'm so tired of taking melatonin. It makes me tired all the time."
Blaze,"Oh, I fuckin' feel you there, buddy. Insomnia, am I right?"
Memphis,"Hey, gamers. Were you talking about Fortnite? No, I'm not even gonna pretend you were talking about Fortnite. I just really love bringing up my favorite game whenever I can."
Memphis,"I, too, have insomnia, but unlike you mine is not caused by depression."
Silver,"Hey, that's not– ...Well, yes, I am depressed. Okay."
Memphis,Mine is because I play so much Fortnite. I stay up late and go to Tilted Towers.
Memphis,"Welcome to my house. As you can see, I've knocked over many chairs because I get so tilted at the towers."
Silver,This isn't really tilted or a tower...
Memphis,"Well, you see, it's a gamer pad. Not many girls come in here cuz I get friendzoned so frequently. But that's okay."
Silver,I'd like to be in the friend zone. I'd like friends.
Memphis,It's not as pleasant as you'd think.
Memphis,They don't treat you like a friend. They treat you like an item.
Memphis,"Sometimes I wish I could be more than just an accessory to these women, but unfortunately, as a gamer, I don't get respect."
Silver,"Well, I'm not a gamer, so maybe they'll respect me!"
Memphis,That just makes you a beta cuck. That's-
Memphis,"That's the difference between you and I, Silver the Hedgehog. (resisting laughter) I'm a— I'm a alpha gamer f–"
Memphis,"Anyway... (laughs) where we— where we droppin', boys? These are all the new maps that they've added, and that's a newspaper."
Blaze,"Have you ever actually interacted with a woman in your life, Mephiles?"
Memphis,That doesn't matter. Check out this cool gem I got on eBay for $7.
Silver,It's so cool. Can I add it to my rock collection?
Sonic,OH! OH MY GOD!! SOMEONE HELP ME!!!
Silver,"Oh my god! That looked like it hurt. What do you think, Blaze?"
Silver,…Blaze?
Blaze,I didn't see it.
Memphis,Give me back my thing.
Memphis,"You see, I had to trap Sonic in the hell dimension 'cause he disrespected gamers."
Memphis,"If you-- If you still-- Anyway, welcome to my purple orb, it's time to go."
Silver,Wait... I don't... nugh!
Elise,Ughhh...
Elise,"Maybe if I-- if I keep thinking really hard, my hands will get clean."
Elise,"I really would like to eat, but there's-- huh?"
Sonic,"Elise! Elise: I really would like to eat, but there's-- huh?"
Elise,"I really would like to eat, but there's-- huh?"
Tails,Hi!
Elise,"H-How'd you get up here, guys?"
Sonic,"Nuh-uh! Oh! Elise: H-How'd you get up here, guys?"
Sonic,Nuh-uh! Oh!
Elise,I need a hug.
Sonic,"Your legs, are they okay? They look really sunburnt."
Elise,"Oh, well, you know…"
Sonic,"Yeah, I do."
Tails,"Oh no, look out!"
Eggman,I have you both-- all of you trapped here.
Eggman,"Now, you can either give her up and we play PUBG together OR..."
Eggman,"…you can stay down here and wrestle in your Fortnite, or whatever the kids are playing now."
Sonic,"PUBGs old news, Eggman!"
Tails,"Yeah, Eggman, you lame-o!"
Sonic,Tetris 99's where it's at!
Robot,NAAAANTS INGONYAMAAAA BAGITHI BABA
Sonic,"Hmm, robots in the sky!"
Tails,Robots in the sky? This is just like that dream I had once about robots in the sky.
Sonic,"Tell it to us in excruciating detail, Tails."
Tails,"Well, it was a whole dream! Bye!"
Ryan,"You fucking knew that was coming, you asshole."
Elise,Oh.
Sonic,You're heavy.
Rouge,Where the fuck are we?
Shadow,"This is the future that zoomers want, Rouge."
Shadow,This is the future of Fortnite.
Rouge,"No, this can't be the future of Fortnite. It's the best game of 2018."
Shadow,"Yeah, but this is like, 20, like, 99 or something."
Shadow,…like 99 tetri– Why is it black and white?
Rouge,I'm so confused. All my Fortnite save files are gone!
Shadow,We found the computer room!
Rouge,We found it! This is it. This is where we make our breakthrough. We're going to make a game.
Rouge,We're gonna combine all the battle royales and make a battle royale better than Fortnite ever was.
Rouge,"Come on. Shadow, you gotta be in this with me."
Shadow,You're right. And I know just the backing music.
Rouge,"Aaaand recording, go."
Shadow,(dooting the Pumpkin Hill theme)
Shadow,YES! The ultimate soundtrack for the ultimate game!
Rouge,Inspired! This is going to be the best game that's ever been made.
Rouge,"We're going to be rich, Shadow. Absolutely rich."
Rouge,All the gamers. All the gamers will be on our side.
Rouge,We'll have an army of gamers to take on the world with.
Shadow,"Y'know, you say that like it's a threatening thing, but have you ever seen a gamer in real life before?"
Rouge,"No, but they have-- they talk big shit."
Shadow,(gasp)
Rouge,What?
Shadow,"Sorry, I thought I heard a cat."
Rouge,"Oh, yeah."
Silver,Ah! Oh.
Silver,"Oh my gosh, this is- Is that what a... (♫ Mad World Instrumental ♫)"
Silver,Is that a rock too? Fuck yeah! This place rules!
Blaze,♪ All around me are familiar Blazes ♪
Blaze,♪ Worn-out Blazes ♪
Blaze,♪ Worn-out Blazes ♪
Blaze,Is that what a house looks like?
Blaze,Oh my god! This place is amazing!
Blaze,"Where am I, the future?"
Blaze,♪ Worn-out Blazes ♪
Blaze,Huh?
Blaze,I thought I heard a cat or something. I dunno.
Silver,"Oh my god, it's the guy on fire! But… he's not on fire? I gotta see what's up."
Amy,"Whoa, wait!"
Amy,"Where you goin', good lookin? Silver: No, I don't-- I don't like being touched!"
Amy,I'm gonna get all up in that crotch! Silver: Please stop! Please stop! Please-
Silver,"No, I hate this. I hate this. Please."
Amy,"You're not my boyfriend! Silver: Go away, please."
Amy,Get outta here! EEW!
Amy,Why would you touch me? Ew! Silver: Ugh! Oh my god!
Amy,EW! PERVERT!
Silver,This is the worst. This is the actual worst. Amy: Pervert! Pervert!
Silver,I wanna go home. I need-- no-- Amy: Pervert!
Silver,"Oh, and now blue guy's gone. This is-- this is-- that's just--"
Silver,My-- my whole good mood is ruined! I-I hope you're happy with yourself.
Amy,I am happy with myself! I have a positive mental attitude!
Silver,"God, I wish that were me."
Silver,"Anyway, go away!"
Amy,"You should just-- Silver: Anyway, go away!"
Amy,You should just cheer up!
Silver,No!
Amy,You can believe in yourself! Friendship!
Silver,Now you're just saying words.
Amy,Wait. Who are you?
Amy,Where are you-- No!
Silver,Hey! No! Let go! Please! Ah! You- Amy: Let go of my hand!
Elise,Ugh... Sonic: We did it!
Elise,"Uh… Thank you. Thanks, I appreciate that."
Elise,My legs are really tired from not walking though.
Elise,"You know how they, like--"
Sonic,"Oh, this? It's my arm."
Elise,Hands are so important.
Elise,When was the last time you washed your hands? I haven't washed mine in four days.
Elise,I've also been eating rocks. That's-- That's my go-to…
Sonic,Rocks?
Elise,…when I've been captured. Yeah!
Elise,"Yeah yeah yeah, they're pretty good. Sonic: Nuh-uh-uh! That's not food!"
Elise,What about grass?
Sonic,"This is food, Elise."
Elise,It's beautiful. I love your new hat.
Elise,I'm gonna name her… Alexa.
Sonic,You threw it away!
Sonic,"Bye, Alexa."
Elise,"Bye, Alexa."
Elise,"I hope she lives her best life, off in the sky."
Sonic,Me too.
Elise,She's gonna become a part of the sky. That's how it works.
Sonic,Come along with me!
Sonic,Why don't you tell me your incredibly complicated backstory...
Sonic,Complete with background visuals!
Elise,"Oh, okay. Yes. So once upon a time, I lived in a kingdom with my family,"
Elise,but the kingdom was on fire or maybe I dreamt it was on fire?
Elise,"Oh, yeah. I know I dreamt it. I dreamt it was on fire and there was a big monster-"
Elise,"Oh my gosh, the sky is so beautiful."
Elise,Eyes.
Elise,Look at the clouds. I saw a pig in the clouds. I just-- I-- But I don't know how.
Elise,It spoke to me.
Elise,It spoke to me like the fire monster.
Elise,"It said: That guy needs some mousse from his mustache, maybe a beard hydrator."
Sonic,I know where to find a mustache. Come on!
Elise,What?
Sonic,How was that?
Elise,"You know, it was all right, it wasn't great. Definitely won't recommend."
Sonic,One!
Elise,"Yeah, one."
Alfred,Oh my fucking god.
Alfred,(cackling)
Silver,"The battle royale game had a soundtrack that was so fire, it set fire to the world."
Silver,And now I need to find the hedgehog-- THERE HE IS!
Sonic,Huh? Who said that?
Sonic,Whoa!
Sonic,"Hold on, I think there's a fan."
Silver,"You must never rap again, or else the world will be destroyed!"
Sonic,Have you even heard my mixtape? It's fire!
Sonic,"AAAAAAH! Silver: Oh, I'm gonna fire at you, into a wall!"
Elise,Um. Oh my gosh. Sonic: Look... I-- I won't rap again.
Sonic,"Okay, I'll do it, I'll throw it away, I promise."
Elise,Guys! Eggman: She's taken by the snap-crackle-pop!
Sonic,"Oh, there she goes."
Silver,You stop!
Sonic,Oh! Silver: Hey!
Silver,I'm not done talking to you!
Sonic,"Okay, what do you want?"
Silver,"First, I want you to apologize. I mean, I was in the middle of talking to you."
Amy,No!
Silver,"Amy? Wait, how do I know your name?"
Amy,I TOLD YOU my name!
Silver,Oh yeah.
Sonic,Ugh.
Sonic,"Thanks Amy, maybe you can feature on my next track."
Amy,Maybe I can feature on your next what?
Sonic,See you later.
Amy,"Aw dammit, I missed my opportunity on Sonic's next album!"
Amy,"It's your fault, Silver boy!"
Amy,"I'm gonna pluck you up, melt you down and make a fucking necklace!"
Silver,"Yeah, I probably deserve it."
Amy,"Oh wait, shit. You don't make this fun 'cause you're sad!"
Silver,I'm always sad. That's just my thing. I-- I'm sorry. I'm sad. I can't--
Silver,"That's just how I be, y'know."
Silver,"That's just how I be, y'know. Amy: Well now I just feel bad."
Amy,Well now I just feel bad. Dammit.
Amy,"Alright, well, I guess, like... We could talk about, like... Future?"
Sonic,Hey Knuckles! Tails: Hey Knuckles!
Knuckles,What up? I'm listening to my Game Boy.
Knuckles,It's got the bomb tunes on it. Check-- Check out my favorite tracks.
Sonic,"Oh, Super Mario Kart?"
Tails,Not Super Mario Kart...
Tails,"(gasps) Eggman?! Eggman: We have pictures of Mario, pictures of Luigi..."
Eggman,"We have pictures of Mario, pictures of Luigi..."
Eggman,"pictures of Princess Daisy, princess of Princess Peach."
Eggman,Did you know that the FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is only done for people who like gaming Minecraft?
Sonic,Interesting.
Knuckles,"Yeah, the remix is a little hard to fucking understand, crush."
Sonic,"Yeah, it sounds like Pumpkin Hill."
Tails,"Now, Knuckles, why would you listen to music on a Game Boy? That's not what a Game Boy is for."
Knuckles,"You're right, it's what a Switch is for."
Sonic,"Not gonna say what I said last time,"
Sonic,'cause that was weird. Alright!
Tails,"Wait, what?"
Knuckles,"Hey, don't take me anywhere--"
Knuckles,Aw fuck!
Hayley,"You have found the computer room. Sonic: Oh god, here we are!"
Tails,"Where are we? (gasps) Ryan: Shut up, Hayley!"
Sonic,Eggman! Tails: Eggman!
Eggman,Welcome to the realm.
Eggman,"Now, I have the epic gamer right here!"
Elise,Hey! Sonic: No!
Eggman,Not the time to drop!
Eggman,"Now, I'm gonna be turning you all into Minecraft PS4s."
Sonic,"But Eggman, she's my heart and soul!"
Eggman,"Give me the gem right now! Sonic: But Eggman, she's my heart and soul!"
Eggman,Give me the gem right now!
Elise,No! Eggman: Give me the gem right now!
Eggman,I don't wanna hear your musky mouth. Put the gem there or I'm gonna put her in Minecraft.
Sonic,Alright.
Elise,"Sonic, don't do it!"
Sonic,Time to give up my 1-up.
Eggman,"That's right. I want that Aquafina, bitch. (slurp) I wanna sip that shit. YES!"
Sonic,WHOA!
Knuckles,üüüüüüü
Tails,Oh no! Knuckles: üüüüüüü
Eggman,"Enjoy your time in Fortnite, boys!"
Sonic,No!
Tails,No!
Sonic,"Wait, is it Fortnite or Minecraft?"
Eggman,"That's for really knowing you to find out, you goddamn nasty hedgehog son of a bitch."
Eggman,I want you gone out of my life.
Eggman,"Look at the size of my nostril, I can smell you from here!"
Elise,Why are you so rude?
Eggman,"Why are you so goddamn pale? Now, get the fuck away from me!"
Eggman,"GET OUTTA MY LIFE, SONIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIC!!!!"
Tails,"Sonic, no! Aaaaah!"
Knuckles,"Eggman, I fucked your wiiiiife!"
Elise,No!
Eggman,I flushed them down the terlet.
Eggman,They'll be seen again.
Eggman,"Now, about those PUBG let's plays, we can start something tonight on twitchtv.com."
Eggman,"Wait, listen, I think we should maybe-- No, not even-- Not even PUBG. We'll go with Fortnite."
Eggman,We'll do Fortnite. We'll create Fortnite. And we'll get Todd Howard on it.
Eggman,"That way, he can make Fallout 76 battle royale."
Eggman,"Then, we have to switch over our plans."
Eggman,"That way, we create the ultimate battle royale experience. And I only need you for it."
Elise,So I'm just gonna let you keep talking and I'm just gonna meditate.
Eggman,"Now, listen, you're the key component!"
Eggman,And you listen to me. You will be my game tester. You'll test all of my battle royale experiences.
Eggman,All the gamers will look up to you. You will be gaming gamer girl queen.
Eggman,You'll have Cheeto Puffs on your fingers. And Twitch Prime will be mine!
Eggman,Now do you agree to do this… or am I gonna have to let you go on the terlet portal like those other ones did.
Elise,"To be honest, I've been visualizing a beach this whole time."
Elise,That's what my dad always told me to do when I was really stressed.
Knuckles,This isn't the beach!
Knuckles,Fuck!
Sonic,I feel like thinking about something but I don't know what.
Knuckles,"I can't think about anything, my brain is... schismed."
Sonic,"Yeah. You okay, Knuckles?"
Knuckles,"No, my corpus callosum is swollen."
Tails,My head's full of jellybeans…
Sonic,Sounds delicious.
Tails,Not really…
Shadow,You.
Sonic,Huh? I heard someone speak to me!
Rouge,"Well, hello boys."
Sonic,These towers are quite tilted.
Shadow,Yes. I tilted them myself.
Shadow,"See, we tried to make a game battle royale, but anyway--"
Tails,Look at this. You ruined everything! This is all your fault!
Knuckles,Shadow. You--
Knuckles,"Listen, you got any weed on you man? Like, since we're here--"
Shadow,"No, what are you the only one who smokes weed here, Knuckles?"
Rouge,Except for maybe Rouge. Rouge?
Sonic,Oh.
Sonic,"Speak for yourself, motherfucker!"
Shadow,"Listen, that's not important. Look!"
Sonic,I'll point at you also.
Shadow,"I'm not in the sky, dick nips."
Knuckles,"Hmm... So, dick nips, where are we going?"
Sonic,Huh? What's happening in here?
Silver,Uh...
Memphis,"As you can see, this is the optimum drop point."
Silver,Oh wait!
Memphis,"Wow, look at my orb, it's big and small!"
Sonic,"Oh, that orb looked big and small!"
Knuckles,…what the fuck?
Tails,Did you guys see that?
Sonic,What is this?
Tails,Where'd they go?
Tails,"Look, it's a big computer!"
Knuckles,…wait …what's on it?
Tails,Somebody's been playing Fortnite.
Knuckles,…aw fuck.
Tails,"Wait, no. Somebody's been building a video game. A battle royale that--"
Sonic,Oh sweet! I want to be the main character!
Shadow,Hmm… got a nice green glowy thing there?
Rouge,"It's weed, obviously."
Rouge,I was hiding it from Knuckles. He wanted it so bad. Did you see the look on his face?
Shadow,"Yes, I did, although it might be irradiated. So you might be slowly developing death."
Rouge,That's fine.
Omega,beep Rouge: That's fine.
Rouge,"We're all gonna die, anyway. What is that?"
Rouge,Looks like a weird cow or something.
Shadow,Looks like a robot that we can't possibly imagine what the voice could sound like.
Rouge,"Maybe if we, like, put weed in it we can make it work good."
Shadow,No.
Rouge,"You won't even try it? Just try my idea for once, Sonic! Uh, Shadow. Fuck."
Rouge,"Just listen to me, like, for once."
Rouge,I'm sorry that I'm bad with names.
Shadow,This is the last fucking time you confuse me with that blue asshole.
Shadow,"You did it once before, you did it again. You did it at our wedding, Rouge."
Rouge,You just look so much alike!
Silver,"You know, maybe things aren't so bad."
Silver,"I'm here, I got the nice ocean breeze."
Silver,Just alone with my thoughts.
Blaze,Hey Silver.
Silver,GODDAMNIT!
Blaze,"What, what's wrong?"
Silver,"Oh, nothing."
Silver,"Hi, Blaze. How are you?"
Blaze,I can tell you want some alone time.
Silver,"I do, but I also feel like I'm just gonna be alone longer than I want if I leave now, so let's go."
Silver,After I—move my lips a bit more.
Silver,"Y'know, Blaze, do you ever stop and think about how—"
Silver,This is really— Blaze: All the time.
Blaze,"All the time, Silver. I can never stop thinking."
Blaze,Sends me into a fit.
Blaze,"Always analyzing, always so superior to everyone around me. Just—"
Blaze,"I know so much, Silver. My brain is too good for this world."
Silver,"Oh, we're in the snow, now. Hey, look, it's a blue!"
Blaze,"Ah, yes, my echolocation located the emerald. As I suspected."
Blaze,I am superior once again.
Blaze,Sliver? We have work to do. Come with me.
Silver,"Awh, I wish I was as cool as you."
Sonic,"This place is so hot! Rouge: Knuckles, why the fuck do you have Legos on your shoes?"
Knuckles,YOU HAD THE WEED THE WHOLE TIME?!
Shadow,YOU INTERRUPTED MY BROODING—
Rouge,"Listen. I have the weed, and I have what you want, so give us what we want."
Knuckles,I need it for my concussion.
Sonic,"Okay, so hand it over! Knuckles: You can't keep my medicine away from me!"
Rouge,"No, you can't have it until you give us what we asked for— Knuckles: YOU CAN'T STOP OUR LOVE."
Rouge,What? (Alfred laughing)
Shadow,"Alright, so this is just getting into crack ship territory."
Sonic,"Okay, OBVIOUSLY this is a sore point."
Tails,"We need to go over there, and just like—fucking chill the fuck out. Everyone is so tense!"
Rouge,"Alright, so we found another— Shadow: HEY, DON'T—!"
Rouge,WHOA! Shadow: What did I JUST say?!
Sonic,Smells like pancakes!
Amy,"Sneaking, sneaking / Into the music studio"
Amy,"Sneaking into Sonic's album!~ Robots: Fuck, do I hear somethin'? I can't hear anything."
Robots,"Hey, have you started on your new single yet?"
Amy,That's his band! Wow.
Amy,I need to sneak inside the— Elise: Oh!
Amy,"Shit! Elise: Yeah—right back at ya, friend!"
Amy,What are you doing here? Elise: Uh...
Amy,"Aw, shit, what did you do?! What did you do to the album?!"
Elise,"I—I just— sneaked! (Robot noises, alarms)"
Elise,"I snea--okay! Amy: Did you leak the album? Goddammit! (Robot noises, alarms)"
Memphis,"Ah, it's so nice to be outside. Blaze: Sucks to be outside. Silver: Yeah."
Silver,"I—I agree with Blaze. You know, this was kind of nice at first, but now I'm all congested—my eyes hurt."
Memphis,"You know, I haven't been in the presence of a fair maiden in... many a year..."
Memphis,"Blaze, it's so nice to be with you. And you—you BETA ORBITER MALE—I can do without you."
Memphis,"But you make me feel stronger and smarter because you're here, so you can stay for now. Silver: Awh..."
Memphis,"Yes, I can feel myself becoming more powerful with all of your insolent little whines."
Memphis,"(Chase laughing, breaking character) I'm gonna do a little dance."
Amy,"So, let me get this straight."
Amy,"You've been—dating... Sonic? The Hedgehog? The blue one, looks like this?"
Elise,"Well—I guess? If that's my story arc, then yes!"
Amy,Yup! I can kill ya!
Amy,"I'll rip your fuckin' throat out, wear it as a fuckin' necktie! (laughter continues)"
Elise,"Oh—Okay? I have no idea what the words you just said mean, but I'm glad we're outside. It's been like—"
Elise,a week. I've lost track of time—I'm not sure if I'm a person.
Amy,"Hmm, you won't be—in just a second!~"
Amy,"So, tell me. Do you enjoy... rocks? In your stomach? Hahaha, that's a fitting punishment, I think, for stealing my boyfriend!"
Amy,"I'll fill your stomach with rocks, twinkle twinkle!"
Elise,"Actually, that's all I've been eating for the past three days."
Amy,You've been eating rocks? You're immune. Dammit!
Amy,"Alright, well how about—I run around like this, and then scare you 'til your heart stops!"
Amy,Boo! YEAAAGH!
Amy,I'm scary!
Amy,"Aw, fuck it, I can't compete."
Amy,"You have—skin, and—hands—that are like, small, and dainty, and can fit in a butthole!"
Sonic,"And she has skin and hands that are small and dainty and can fit in a butthole. She's the girl of my dreams, Shadow!"
Shadow,I have one of those too. He's very very nice.
Shadow,ZA WARUDO!
Rouge,You may now kiss the bride.
Shadow,"Wait, Sonic, which of us is the bride? Sonic!"
Knuckles,"Wait, agh, shit. Shadow: SONIC, I NEED AN ANSWER!"
Rouge,"Come on, Shadow, it's time for the reception."
Shadow,"No, I don't know which one of us is the bride, and that's kind of like a thing for—oh, God."
Memphis,"Go on, Shadow, don't you support gay rights?"
Shadow,I do!
Memphis,"Look at this weird flame in front of me, it's REALLY BIG!"
Shadow,Oh! Memphis: Doesn't that intimidate you?!
Shadow,"Sorry, I had you confused for Sonic. I thought WE were getting married, Mee-philes."
Memphis,"Come kiss me, boy!"
Sonic,Oh! Alright! Knuckles: FUCK my ass.
Sonic,Where's that sweet cake?
Knuckles,"My brain again. Tails: We made it, we're back!"
Sonic,"Tails, did you forget to decorate the pavilion? Tails: No! I--I wasn't in charge of decorations."
Sonic,"Oh my god, of course."
Sonic,"Oh, the invitation! You didn't hand it out!"
Knuckles,I put it on the ground as a decoration. Sonic: To the best wedding of the century!
Tails,"Congratulations, Sonic! Sonic: Oh my god."
Knuckles,"Wait, but you got married in the future. Sonic: No."
Robots,Hello. Hello. Can I have your number? Penny: (wheezing) Are you kidding me?!
Robots,Beep. Borp. Instant ramen. Beep. Borp. Robot noises. Anyone here got weed?
Eggman,"You thought you could get away, gamer girl. You thought that you could fuckin' escape me, gamer girl."
Eggman,But my IQ is too HIGH!
Omega,It looks like that I am trapped in the middle of a forest as Alpha and Omega 3.
Omega,No one else is going to be out here to save me so I must get away immediately.
Rouge,"Well, Hel~lo, nurse!"
Omega,"Who is this gross bat specimen trying to talk to me? Get away from me, thotticus."
Rouge,"Hi! You are quite a hunk of metal, aren't you?"
Omega,And you're quite one-polygon titted.
Rouge,"Here, you want some weed? Omega: I do not have lungs. So I cannot smoke weed."
Omega,But I will take it anyway. And put it directly into my braincells. Here we go.
Omega,HOOOOOLYYYY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Omega,IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII (cast laughing)
Omega,"IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII Ryan: Keep holding it, keep holding it, keep holding it!"
Omega,IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT Ryan: Keep holding it! Yes!
Omega,(inhales) WOw.
Hayley,"Oh, fuck me running. Rouge: How does it feel? Are you enjoyin' it?"
Omega,What planet am I on? What's today? My braincell: Destroyed. My wig is gone.
Rouge,Buh-bye~!
Omega,I-- uh-- alright. I'll best be going now. No one will ever follow me with my knife hands.
Memphis,"(laughing) Hello there, Shadow the Hedgehog! It's so good to see you in my"
Memphis,new Fortnite map I'm developing.
Shadow,I was actually meaning to ask you a question:
Shadow,Are you seeing anyone right now? Because there's no one sexier than myself.
Memphis,(chuckles)
Memphis,"Why? Are you– are you interested because, um, I was actually thinking you and I are pretty similar."
Shadow,"Bruh, I wouldn't be asking if I wasn't interested. Memphis: Check out my– look at my cool shield."
Memphis,"It's made of 17,000 polygons and it's also–"
Memphis,"P-Purple and glowy which is your favorite color, I've been told."
Memphis,"Regardless, as I– as I said, previously, this is my new Fortnite map. I'm developing–"
Memphis,I'm developing it in this volcano and people will play it in real life.
Memphis,"If you die in the game, you die in real life, Shadow the Hedgehog."
Shadow,How did you know Sword Art Online was my favorite anime? You should have known that I had terrible taste.
Memphis,I know more about you than you could ever compreh– is that Sonic? How the fuck did he get here?
Memphis,What the fuck is he doing in my shield?
Memphis,"You know him, right? You guys are exes or something. Get him out of my fucking shield!"
Memphis,"If this relationship is going to work, you can't Shadow: No, don't you see?"
Memphis,"bring your exes. You know how uncomfortable that makes me, sweetie."
Memphis,Please. Let him– just go– make him go away.
Shadow,"Mephistopheles, please. I didn't know I was marrying him. I only thought it was you"
Shadow,because you look so similar.
Memphis,"My name is Memphis, Tennessee, and I will have you respect my name."
Memphis,"Here he is; he's still here. Why– why is he here? Like, how did he even get in there?"
Shadow,I don't know.
Shadow,Maybe we put a chicken bone in there or something and he just couldn't resist.
Memphis,He is that stupid. I'm glad we can still bond over how dumb your ex is.
Shadow,Ugh!
Shadow,That felt great.
Memphis,"I know exactly how you like it, baby. And now, check it out."
Memphis,This is my new Steven Universe Crystal Gem cosplay.
Shadow,"God. Omega: I need you to stop right now,"
Omega,for you are not a true gem. You are nothing but a fraud.
Memphis,Oh my god. (violent choking noises) What the fuck. Oh my god.
Memphis,I told you not to invite your asshole friends over and now I– I–
Shadow,I've never met this hunk of metal but I love him.
Memphis,I'm so fucking high right now. He's just here and I got secondhand smoke inebriated. I'm fucking leaving. I'm going back to my parents house until you get your asshole friends in order. Fuck you.
Shadow,Who the fuck are you?
Omega,"Shadow, wait, please don't–"
Omega,"Oh, god. Shadow I only came to admit my true feelings for you."
Shadow,Ah. A world where everyone loves me.
Omega,"It's everything about you. From your hot sauce hair, to your jet boots. Everything that you do is–"
Shadow,Mhm.
Omega,"Are you even listening to me, Shadow?"
Rouge,Hello~!
Shadow,Hey. Omega: Oh god. It's young thotticus once again.
Rouge,"Well, it is quite a pleasure to meet you here. Didn't expect you to be here, Shadow."
Shadow,"I didn't expect to be here either, but here you are with your–"
Omega,Fortnite: Battle Royale will be the biggest game of 2018 if we do not stop that giant.
Shadow,"Thank you, YouTube algorithm. Now go ahead and screw over some more creators."
Rouge,"Wait, Shadow!"
Shadow,"I said I'm going against YouTube now. That's– that's my character arc now, baby."
Omega,"You look like YouTube Red, why are you making fun of me."
Rouge,"Shadow, let me help you! Don't do this all by yourself. We were going to make"
Rouge,the best game together!
Rouge,(scoffs) We'd make such a good team.
Rouge,"Honestly, name a more iconic duo. Omega: Do you have any more weed?"
Shadow,"Little does she know, I hold the game file and–"
Eggman,"Mmm, the game is almost finished."
Shadow,"Hey Eggman, I found the computer room!"
Eggman,I'm actually Todd Howard now cuz I sell all the video games.
Shadow,"That's what they all say. Now quickly,"
Shadow,I need you to publish my game. Eggman: Shadow. You are my greatest creation of all
Eggman,time from the battle royale
Shadow,What? Eggman: and now look at you.
Shadow,"Wait, hold on. Are you my dad?"
Eggman,(chuckles) Where do you think you got all your characteristics?
Shadow,Of being an asshole? That would explain a lot.
Eggman,(chuckles) Look. The only thing I didn't give you is my realistic four penetrating nipples
Eggman,"Coming off my chest, Shadow. That's all you don't have. But when you do have is the battle."
Eggman,the experience to be a true Fortnite twink player.
Shadow,"Well, if you're my daddy, it makes the last dub horrifying. God."
Chase,"Okay."
Ryan,"Alright, cool."
Alfred,"Alright, okay. Welp."
Sonic,Elise! I'm so glad I saved you from that train!
Elise,"Oh, me too. It was so fast. I was so scared."
Sonic,I know. Woah!
Silver,"Hey, I saw you rescue Elise from that train. It was really cool. Can we be friends?"
Sonic,"Uh, no, I don't like you very much. You're weird."
Silver,Awwwh...
Silver,Now I'm sad! (Sonic screaming)
Silver,Take that!
Silver,uuh...
Silver,"This is what a cool does, right?"
Elise,How could you do this?
Eggman,Why don't you come with me again?
Sonic,No! Not again!
Shadow,"Hey. Oh, I haven't met you twink."
Silver,Wait.
Silver,You! You're the one!
Shadow,"Who did what? Wait, what'd I do? I mean, what didn't I do? I mean look at me. I'm so hot, ya know?"
Shadow,You made a rap so fire..
Sonic,"This doesn't change you leaving me at the altar! Wait, I guess it does, see ya!"
Shadow,Hey.
Silver,I'm gonna take you out to save the world!
Shadow,Good luck with that I have weed.
Shadow,See ya.
Silver,(whimpering in pain)
Shadow,Don't you know? Weed makes you fast. That's a factual thing.
Silver,What's a weed?
Shadow,"Oh my god, you can tell you're white..."
Shadow,"Anyway, I finished putting the game-- I sent it to Eggman. He's going to upload it soon."
Silver,No...
Silver,It's too late now. I can't go back in time again because... I can't go back in time again.
Silver,That's just it.
Silver,"But maybe this Blue will save the world, maybe? Here."
Shadow,"Woah, green! Silver: Blue!"
Shadow,What did we just do?
Shadow,Did we do that together? Was that like a gay thing?
Silver,It's always a gay thing. I thought that's just how it worked.. I'm gonna go.
Shadow,"God bless you Sonic Team. God bless you. Well, if you need to go, then go; I'm gonna chill out here and make sure that it gets picked up by some big successful game development company that'll be around for a long time like Blizzard."
Silver,I was talking about taking a shit.
Shadow,"What? Okay... go ahead. I don't know why you need a portal to take a shit,"
Shadow,"but, I mean, if you want to send your shit to the future, then..."
Shadow,Go ahead. I'm not judgmental. At all.
Silver,"Wait, no, don't go in that! That's the toilet!"
Eggman,"Now, you are going to play this game Elise, or else I'm going to push you off of this fucking--"
Elise,"I mean, I could jump. That could happen too."
Eggman,Or I could push you off of this polygon mountain.
Eggman,"Now, what is the choice Elise? You can either die, die, or--"
Sonic,No! Don't do either of those!
Elise,"Okay, I will do my own thing."
Elise,"Okay, I will do my own thing. Eggman: Go do it."
Sonic,No! Eggman: No Elise! I didn't mean it!
Sonic,Woah! You scared the hell outta me.
Eggman,Give me back my gamer girl Sonic!
Sonic,"She's my gamer girl now. Ain't that right, baby? Come with me. Thumbs up! Elise: Oh, my legs. They weak. My legs are weak."
Elise,"Yeah, good job. Good job, Sonic. I'm proud of you. Yeah, that was kind of scary. All right, let's-- let's bounce."
Sonic,"Oh, you want to play God of War?"
Sonic,Huh? Elise: Huh?
Sonic,Who's that?
Sonic,Instant ramen!
Robot,Find them. Find the gamer girl. We have to find the gamer girl.
Elise,"Oh yeah, the filter changed. It's great, isn't it?"
Sonic,I love Instagram. Let's go to Snapchat.
Elise,"It's amazing what natural sunlight in a filtered game will do, right?"
Sonic,"I know right? Like, you know, you just need that vitamin D."
Elise,My skin looks amazing now.
Elise,"Oh my god. Sonic: I know. Oh, do you exfoliate Elise?"
Elise,"Well, yes, I-I guess."
Sonic,That's my tree.
Elise,Oh my gosh. It's beautiful.
Elise,I wanna hug it. Can I hug your tree?
Elise,"Is that allowed? Do I have to ask permission? Sonic: Oh, well, I guess."
Sonic,"Just, you know, don't get too friendly with it."
Elise,"Okay, I promise. I'll keep my hands to myself then. I'll just put my hands back here and admire it from afar."
Sonic,"Well, you can't hug without hands Elise."
Sonic,Make up your damn mind!
Elise,"I did! I decided that cosplay wasn't consent, and I'm just gonna thank you for bringing me to your tree."
Elise,It's so wonderful. It's putting me in all the right moods.. of being.. happy.
Sonic,"Well, what are some of those moods? Huh?"
Elise,"Well happy is one, like I just said, and um..."
Elise,"Hungry. Hungry is a good mood. I've eaten nothing but rocks, as I've said, for a while."
Elise,Some plants would be a nice change to rocks.
Duke,My child. My baby girl. Don't worry.
Elise,Dad used to feed me plants.
Elise,It was nice.
Elise,I think I'm starting to hallucinate. It's been a while.
Elise,I just keep getting kidnapped.
Sonic,How about a hot dog? No additives.
Elise,That sounds wonderful. Um..
Elise,I'm gonna try not to cry now.
Elise,"Because that sounds-- I'm-- I need a minute. I need a minute, Sonic."
Sonic,"No, let it out. It's fine. Oh!"
Elise,Thank you..
Elise,"Thank you. Sonic: Oh, yeah, I mean.."
Sonic,"Yo, you gotta support your friends."
Shadow,(grunts) Silver: (whimpers)
Silver,Ow.. (whimpering) It hurts..
Shadow,Sewer system's a lot more intricate than I expected.
Duke,"Well, you better find it quick, because if we don't find it, we're not gonna be able to play Fortnite!"
Duke,I don't give a shit you better fucking fix it!
Duke,Wait..
Duke,What are you doing here!? Get out!
Shadow,What was that? Silver: I don't know. It sounded like yellow!
Shadow,I knew there was too much yellow in this world.
Shadow,"If I could do anything, I would eradicate 3 colors. Yellow, silver, and then silver again."
Silver,"Oh.. You meant me.. Shadow: No, no, not like you Silver, just like uh.."
Shadow,There's something about it like.. the person that silver kind of is.
Shadow,"Okay. Yeah. No, I don't like you Silver. What are you looking at?"
Silver,"This is really gross, but I can't look away. Ya know, it be like that sometimes."
Shadow,"Oh, God, it's like a pimple popping video."
Silver,(whimpers) I hate those.
Shadow,"Oh, God, I know that coughing."
Silver,"Oh, is it the weed? Is that what that is?"
Shadow,Close. It's my lover.
Duke,Take this. Protect my daughter from the gamers!
Duke,Take this gamer reflective stone.
Silver,I'll go check on the purple.
Shadow,"That's not weed, and you don't even look cool."
Duke,And now... I'll die.
Shadow,"Oh, God. Is that what I look like when I inevitably melt from over saturation of capital- capitalism?"
Shadow,I dunno. I guess that's where I'm going. I had a YouTube thing going.
Shadow,"Oh great emerald, tell me what I'm supposed to fucking do in this dub!"
Memphis,"Shadow, I'm trying to reform, help. Baby, help."
Shadow,"Oh, it's you! Memphis: I'm made of vape smoke babe, come on."
Shadow,"Oh, wait, he's made of- Wait, have you turned to vaping?"
Memphis,"Yeah babe, I'm made of purple jewel stuff. C'mon. Shadow: Is that really wise move?"
Shadow,"Well, I suppose this time, but you better cut that vaping out. Just kidding, you're getting thermosed baby!"
Memphis,"No, don't put me in your red face! No, don't vape me! Shadow: Get in the thermos. Get in the thermos."
Shadow,Get in the-- Get in! Get in the thermos. Get in the thermos! Get in!
Shadow,Pokéball that motherfuckin' vape!
Memphis,(moan)
Memphis,(wincing moan)
Shadow,Now I carry around my boyfriend wherever I desire.
Shadow,And what do you know? The perfect shape.
Silver,(whining)
Silver,"I leave for five minutes, and this happens?!"
Duke,"You've got to take care of the-- take care of the explosion, or we'll all die."
Duke,"You have a high five on your forehead, that means you are an epic gamer."
Duke,I'm going to take my daughter away so that way we can't die.
Duke,"Sweetie, remember, listen. Silver: Don't go toward it! What's wrong with you?"
Duke,Don't-- ...Shut up. I'm gonna resurrect her right now. Baby take the gamer gems.
Silver,Wha? Cool! Duke: I can't believe this..
Duke,By the power of gaming..
Duke,"I fucking live, and so will my daughter."
Duke,"Now, gamers, unite! Bring back my daughter!"
Duke,It worked! Oh my God!
Duke,(choked crying) Wait. Wait. The gamer piss. It killed her!
Duke,(while crying) No! Elise!
Duke,(overdramatic crying) The gamers..
Duke,"Silver... Take her to E3, and see the-- Silver: I don't think I can carry her."
Silver,Oh! She's very heavy. I'm not strong. Duke: Silver. Silver.
Duke,Just think about where you were before you--
Silver,I-- Where I was everything was on fire..
Duke,(shudders) My baby girl gamer...
Duke,You'll find your peace in another-- (choking crying)
Silver,This seems really private. I feel like I shouldn't be here for this.
Duke,(while choking) Shut the fuck up. I'm talking to my my daughter.
Duke,(sniffing and crying) Okay...
Silver,My arms hurt. Duke: Thank you so much...
Duke,"Your hair looks like ketchup, and you have the pale face of mayonnaise, but you will live."
Duke,I know you will.
Silver,"If you don't wrap it up, I'm gonna drop her. This, uh, it really hurts. Duke: Goodbye.. My ba--"
Silver,Okay. I just gotta... Urgh... Oh God.
Silver,"(struggling) Hold on... girl, I... I'll just... carry... you... Aargh--"
Silver,(whining panting) Shadow: Hey.
Silver,(whining crying) I can't.. feel my arms!
Shadow,"I see you got yourself somebody. Not like romantically, because that'd be weird. Silver: (crying) It hurts! Oh no.."
Silver,(crying) Oh no! Where do I put this girl!?
Silver,"(crying, sighs of relief) Shadow: Oh, mood."
Silver,(sighing) Finally.. (exhausted panting) Oh my God..
Shadow,"What do you think, boo? Memphis: I think you should let me out of your fucking vaper, babe."
Shadow,"Hm... Hey, think she likes vaping?"
Memphis,"No, she's like 11. Silver: No, that's... I don't think that's--"
Shadow,"I think we should let her vape. Give her the freedom to vape. All living things deserve freedom, Sliver."
Shadow,"Freedom to weed, to vape, to Fortnite. That's what we're all tying into, I think."
Shadow,That's a central message. Silver: I only know one of those is...
Silver,Can you carry me--? Shadow: No.
Silver,Oh... okay...
Elise,(tired groans)
Silver,How did she sleep through all of that?
Silver,Well whatever. I wish I could sleep. Bye.
Random Citizen,"Oh my God, there's a ship in the sky!"
Random Citizen,Ice cream ship!~
Random Citizen,Is Todd Howard driving an ice cream truck?
Amy,"Oh fuck! That's where I put my dildo! Aw dammit! Aw shit, I gotta go tell Sonic! Fuuuuuuu--"
Royal Staff,Uh ma'am? Uh ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am--
Elise,"I've been told how to think about the ocean when I'm stressed, and I'm looking at that, and I'm real stressed."
Elise,I'm just gonna go meditate. I'mma think of the ocean..
Elise,Bye guys. I'm a peacin' out. I'll let you deal with this.
Royal Staff,Ma'am you're the ruler of this kingdom! You have to act!
Silver,"Ugh... Oh, now my legs hurt. Everything--"
Blaze,Oh.
Silver,"Blaze, help me. Everything hurts."
Blaze,"So, do you have fun on your little adventures?"
Silver,No! I didn't!
Silver,I didn't have fun at all. My eyeliners ruined. My arms hurt.
Silver,"I got kicked in the head. I hate everything, and I didn't even know I could do that. I'm usually just sad."
Blaze,"That's okay, baby. I know you're lost without me. Be sure never to leave my side again, okay?"
Silver,Okay...
Omega,"Take that. And that! You motherfucker! You steal Shadow away from me, I take your fucking skull! You motherfucking bitch!"
Memphis,"Yo, you chill the hell out dude, I'm too high for this."
Memphis,"All right, anyway, uh..."
Memphis,This is the last time I try to have bots play on my Fortnite server.
Omega,You are nothing but a Fortnite PR fake and a actual diamond accessory.
Memphis,What the fuck does that even mean? Those string of words just absolutely mean nonsense to me.
Memphis,You are so far below me you lowly little trash can man.
Omega,You are nothing but a fake game writer. You will never find happiness you PIECE OF SHIIIIIIIT! (gunfire)
Memphis,Ow! Dickhead! What the fuck!? I'm gonna lay down. I need a second after that. Jesus lord..
Memphis,"Ugh, I'm turning into vape juice, no-!"
Omega,"Shadow, my baby. I am so sorry."
Omega,I had to get rid of him because he was gonna get rid of everything. Also does Rouge have more weed? 'Cause I need that weed.
Omega,My fucking system modules were breaking. My DD4R was breaking on the inside. But I really love you Shadow.
Shadow,"Look, I don't know what your DDR machine is but--"
Shadow,That was an amazing dance!
Rouge,It was so good. You're an icon!
Rouge,You're gonna be more famous than Freddie Mercury!
Omega,I've been doing the JB block boy and b-boy dances all of my life. Also no one knows how to do the shuffle like I do.
Omega,"Listen Shadow, I'm gonna come out and just say it to you because.. my brain broken, and my heart knows what it desires."
Omega,Shadow. You are the one.
Shadow,"Wait, uh, Rouge do you hear something?"
Rouge,"Uh, only the sound of..."
Rouge,"I don't know. The ocean, I guess?"
Omega,Is this the friendzone?
Rouge,"Unfortunately, yes. This is what the friendzone feels like. Something I've felt more times than I care to say."
Shadow,"I don't know how to reciprocate against someone who's that amazing of a dancer but-- Listen we have more things to worry about right now, troupe."
Eggman,(evil snicker) Back in my lair once more.
Eggman,How many times are you gonna run? I've captured you 17 different times!
Elise,I feel like it's gonna be at least 18.
Eggman,The caucasity of this bitch.
Eggman,You run and run. I am an alpha male gamer.
Eggman,She be like This asshole...
Eggman,"I love Fortnite. Without me, you wouldn't even exist! Without me, you wouldn't be able to contain the demon because of gaming!"
Eggman,"Look around you. Imagine... Dragons. Now imagine it. Gaming, on Fortnite BR."
Elise,"I'm imagining the ocean, because, I've established that when I don't want to be somewhere, that's what I think of."
Eggman,"Frank Ocean can't save you now, sweetheart."
Eggman,No one's coming for you. No one's after you. I know what your father wanted for you.
Eggman,"So you're gonna do this whether you like it or not. Now let me log on to my Epic Games account, and let's see what we can--"
Computer,Welcome to EpicGames.com. Beep. Computer room located.
Eggman,"Now let's see... If someone hacked into my Fortnite account, I'm going to have a birth of cactuses out of my asshole."
Computer,Currently being hacked.
Eggman,(demonic high pitched screeching)
Sonic,"Welp, gotta take care of these guys."
Robot,I'mma kill you. Fuck you. Sonic: Who are you?
Robot,"Aggghh! Sonic: Oh my God, it's Blue Man Group!"
Robot,It is no use.
Silver,"Oh, I missed, um, bye!"
Robot,Oh no--! (robots crashing)
Silver,I'm sorry about mistaking you for the rapper: Shadow the Hedgehog.
Sonic,"That's okay. My work is much better though, right?"
Shadow,"Hm, the desert."
Omega,Count how many sand is here Omega. That's your first mission. Omega: Okay.
Omega,1. 2. 3. 4. Rouge: Why the fuck would you make him do that?
Omega,5. 6. 7. Rouge: It's gonna take so long! Shadow: It passes the time.
Omega,8. 9. 10. 11. Rouge: Shadow! It's gonna be so annoying!
Omega,12. 13. Shadow: (Almost laughing) I'm curious what it thinks its number is. (Cast laughs hysterically)
Omega,14. 15. 16. 17. Rouge: No! He's just gonna be counting forever!
Omega,18. 19. Shadow: Perhaps...
Omega,20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. (Cast continues to laugh hysterically)
Omega,"27. 28. 29. 30. Rouge: Shadow, what have you brought? This is your fault!"
Omega,There are only 30 million sand particles in this desert.
Shadow,See? That was easy. Rouge: Oh fuck.. Oh my God.
Memphis,"Ya know, being an independent- Shadow: Oh my God, purple!"
Memphis,"Shh, please don't interrupt me. (Cast laughs)"
Memphis,Being an independent gaming developer has made me realize I have so much more potential.
Memphis,Please support my Patreon in my new startup industry.
Memphis,I will be selling and renti-- What? Shadow: Omega! Count the-- Count the number of grains of sand in this room!
Omega,Okay. 1. 2. 3. 4. Rouge: Shadow!
Omega,"(counting in the background) Rouge: What the fuck dude? Memphis: I was going to compete with him to see who could count better,"
Omega,(counting in the background)
Memphis,"but apparently, he's already on it, so, whatever. Anyway."
Memphis,"Fucking... okay-- Shadow: Okay, you can stop now!"
Memphis,"Look, just listen to me, and I will give you this orange juice gem."
Shadow,Just kidding. Keep counting. It's your one mission.
Shadow,Now listen.... Listen here. Omega: (continues counting)
Shadow,You won't be able to stop the power of this game. We have mass computing power as you can see by our robot.
Memphis,"(evil laugh) You silly feeble-minded little gay. I am so far beyond Fortnite. I have moved on, and my stardom will end the world!"
Omega,WHAAAAAAAH!
Memphis,"You can see, this power is already farther than you could look. Everything is purple! It's great! Oh my God, look at how high resolution I am!"
Memphis,"Aah, no, ack! Shadow: This is-- His game is better, it looks way better!"
Memphis,"(dying noises) Shadow: However, he paid the price of his solenoid greatest game."
Shadow,"Wait, how'd I get this again? Didn't leave in the past? Rouge: Get him Shadow. He's our gaming competition."
Rouge,With him out of the way- Omega: It's time for him to go.
Omega,"No more Fortnite. Memphis: (Silly voice) I'm just a little blob boy now, fuck you!"
Memphis,"Hehe, this is what sound like as a cloud. Fuck yo-- Oh no! Sh--!"
Shadow,"Gotta catch em all, baby! Cuz he's... Shadow."
Shadow,Was NOT expecting explosions!
Rouge,What just happened? What did you do?
Omega,He went into the jar. Never to be seen again--
Memphis,"Oh my God, my neck."
Memphis,I need to see a chiropractor.
Memphis,"Oh my... Oh my God. Oh my God, did you see that?"
Memphis,"Fuck you for making me go through that dude! Shadow: He's right! 10,000 years really made you such a crick in the neck!"
Memphis,"You guys suck. Really, I can't believe I used to date you. You used to be cool dude. Shadow: Have you met me?"
Shadow,I was really cool. Memphis: Yeah.
Memphis,"You're sexy as fuck, but you're also a dickhead. You've stuck me in your jewel."
Shadow,"You know what they say-- Memphis: I don't know what they say, and I don't care what they say."
Memphis,"Look at my army of Me's. I'm going to fuck me, because I can't trust anybody with my penis except for myself."
Memphis,Can you believe me? Have you ever fucked a clone? It's great.
Memphis,"They know all the right places, and I have ten million of them to go around."
Shadow,But Mephiles! Fucking you is my job!
Memphis,"Not anymore, baby! Not ever since I became an independent game--"
Shadow,Joke's on you. This is a dream come true for me. Memphis: Would you shut the fuck up?
Memphis,"I swear to God, I didn't invite you to my house. I have it--"
Memphis,"I put it on Facebook that I was having a homecoming party because-- Shadow: Omega, count how many mouths he has!"
Omega,Okay...
Shadow,"Yeah, exactly! You ain't got no mouths, bitch!"
Shadow,"Hyah! Memphis: Oh, we have to get him before he leaves."
Memphis,He's cra-- He's crashing my great fucking home warming party-- Oh my God!
Memphis,No! What the fuck? My clones! Shadow: Haaaaah!
Shadow,Teriaaaa! Memphis: No! Dickhead! You're the worst!
Eggman,God-- Wait-- What's happening? Wait-- No! The battle royale! It's being--
Computer,Currently being hacked! Eggman: It's being destroyed!
Eggman,What's happened? What's going on? Why is Fortnitebeing destroyed-- Computer: Your account is compromised!
Eggman,NO! GOD DAMMIT! I spent so many hours getting all those skins! The dances!
Eggman,They're all gone! Noooo!
Eggman,They're all gone! Noooo! Computer: Your social security is someone else's!
Sonic,Oh! I wanted a Spongebob popsicle!
Silver,I like the Bubbles ones.
Sonic,You WHAT?
Silver,"You know, from Powerpuff Girls?"
Sonic,"Oh, I never thought someone could be so misguided..."
Sonic,AUGHHH! (slams fist down in anger)
Silver,"Yeah... that's my name and my game. Wait, how does that saying go?"
Silver,I'll shut up now. Blaze: Don't be so hard on him Sonic.
Sonic,I'll be as hard on him as I wanna be.
Silver,"That's very suggestive, but also, if you're offering, then I'd be happy to. Ya know?"
Sonic,...What??
Silver,"Oh, um okay, I'm sorry. Have a diamond."
Sonic,Yeah! Time travel! Again! Silver: (Whimpers)
Sonic,"Silver, you know what?"
Sonic,You're a twink.
Sonic,I'm gonna go smoke some weed now.
Silver,How long were you waiting to say that?
Sonic,"The whole dub, baby!"
Silver,"Yeah, I figured. Okay. have fun."
Ryan,That is the tagline of this dub.
Alfred,Just... Silver is a twink.
Silver,"Wait, nevermind, I'm coming with you."
Sonic,"Oh! Wait, did we time-- (yelps)"
Silver,"Oh, what the heck?"
Silver,What are we doing here? And why am I still holding it?
Blaze,"You're holding it because we have a job to do, Silver T. Hedgehog."
Silver,Is the job to be gross?
Silver,"Oh, but we're really good at that. Blaze: No. The job is to facilitate maAA--"
Sonic,Woah!
Silver,Oh no.. Blaze: I'm going to sacrifice myself Silver.
Silver,"No, please, you're too good-- You're not only too good for this world, but also any other world that could possibly exist."
Silver,"Here, let me try hitting it with-- (yelps of pain)"
Blaze,"Silver, there's no other way! You'll die! Silver: (cries in pain)"
Silver,"No, I can do this! I can be-- I can be a cool boy. I'm cool! Blaze: Silver, quit it! Silver! Quit it! Silver!"
Blaze,Who will pass on my legacy if you are gone?
Blaze,"It's my job, Silver. I will take on this burden. Treat me like a goddess!"
Blaze,(groans)
Silver,I think I already did but okay.
Blaze,"Silver! When they talk about me in the future, make sure my name is something cool. Like... Jessica Grimdock."
Silver,Or Blaze?
Blaze,"Yes! The coolest name in the world! That was a test Silver, and you passed."
Silver,"Finally, I did something right!"
Blaze,Silver? Silver: What is it?
Silver,"What is it, Blaze? Blaze: I'm almost proud of you."
Silver,(gasp) That's the most proud of me you've ever been!
Blaze,"When you think of me, think of approximate gratitude!"
Blaze,HUUGH!
Silver,Noooo!
Blue,"Oh my fucking God, she's fucking dead!"
Blaze,"Wait, that wasn't me saying that!"
Blaze,WHO'S THERE!?
Silver,She went out the way we all want to. By turning into mist and sparkles after holding two diamonds.
Silver,"Oh, it's so bright out now. I wanna go inside."
Blaze,You are still my bitch... (bitch echoes)
Silver,I always will be.
Sonic,Woah! Oh! We gotta escape from-- somewhere?! (Someone bursts out laughing)
Sonic,How did we get here?
Elise,Go that way!
Sonic,"Okay, but it looks like we're gonna have to ju-jump!"
Elise,What else is new? You've done that five times.
Sonic,"What? I can't hear you, it's loud! Here we go!"
Sonic,Woah! Elise: Woah!
Sonic,(screaming)
Sonic,We might do this. We're gonna make it! We're gonna make it!
Sonic,We're gonna make it!
Sonic,There's no way we can't make it!
Narrator,Is this the end for Sonic the Hedgehog?
Narrator,No!
Sonic,Elise!
Elise,(panting)
Sonic,Elise. Guess what?
Elise,What?
Sonic,I can never die!
Sonic,Nice smile!
Sonic,Wink.
Sonic,"Ew! No, it was gross on you. Elise: Wink."
Memphis,"Finally, the corrupted weed gem!"
Memphis,Finally those assholes will stop following me around and I can move on from my life.
Memphis,"I used to be into Fortnite. Yeah, sure, we all had that kind of phase."
Memphis,That doesn't mean I want to keep dating my Fortnite boyfriend and inviting him to my new apartment every time I have a party.
Sonic,Oh. I feel potent angst energy in this forest Elise!
Sonic,Woah!
Robots,(Beep in the tune of Darude Sandstorm)
Sonic,I feel so distracted!
Memphis,What the fu-- What are you people doing on my front lawn? Get out of here!
Sonic,(gasps in pain)
Memphis,"Oh my God. Oh my God, are you okay? Holy shit."
Memphis,"I--I-- I don't think I should pull it out. I think if I pull it out, he'll bleed out. Oh my God. Oh my God."
Memphis,I didn't mean to do that. Oh my god. Oh-- Sonic: You were right! I'm bleeding out!
Memphis,I mean-- Sonic: All over the ground.
Sonic,"Oh my God, there's so much visible rendered blood!"
Elise,"Oh no, Sonic! Sonic!"
Memphis,"I mean, you shouldn't have come on my property. You scared me. I'm sorry. I didn't know what I was doing."
Memphis,Oh my God. I'm gonna fucking puke.
Elise,"Wake up! Wake up, Sonic! Please!"
Elise,No... His hand.. It was the most beautiful part... of him.
Elise,Oh no. I'm having a flashback.
Elise,(crying) Nooooo!
Memphis,"Oh, my God. Oh my God. What the fuck?"
Memphis,"Yo, it's yellow! Oh my God. Yo, I'm purple. That's yellow."
Memphis,Ooohhh! Complimenting the color baby~
Memphis,"Okay, this'll look really good on my mantle. If I can just solidify this yellow essence into, like, a crystal or something, that would be dope."
Omega,We are trapped in the tar. This is what it looks like. This is America.
Rouge,"God. Fucking thanks, BP!"
Shadow,"Better not catch you slipping now Omega. Now let's see, now that I got my rings back on, I can... wear rings."
Shadow,"Oh! Omega: Shadow, be careful, that is the power of Sprite!"
Shadow,"Oh, Sprite! Rouge: Ah!"
Shadow,I'm more of a Coca-Cola fan!
Memphis,"Now I have all the colors of the rainbow, and I can unleash my true gay power!"
Memphis,(maniacally laughs)
Memphis,Now everyone's my boyfriend!
Memphis,(maniacally laughs)
Citizen,"Oh, hey! My beds fit!"
Tails,What the fuck is happening? What are these feelings?
Silver,Oh my God. It almost went as white as me!
Silver,That's bad!
Silver,"Oh no! No, not you again! Amy: Oh my God."
Shadow,"Oh Christ, it's you guys. Omega: What's up bitches?"
Amy,Rouge!
Eggman,(laughing)
Eggman,Cock.
Shadow,"Mood, Eggman, mood. Omega: Cooooooooock."
Eggman,Mm. You know how long I've been craving some gamer dick?
Eggman,Since 1907.
Eggman,Sonic's finally dead.
Amy,"Woah! Shadow: Wait, he's dead?"
Amy,Holy shit! You killed my boyfriend?
Tails,"No, Sonic! Amy: Wait. Shadow: Fuck yeah."
Tails,Oh no! What happened to him Elise?
Amy,I'll never get to play.. the song I wrote for him.
Amy,"Maybe if I sing it now, it'll help!"
Shadow,Don't... Amy: (dooting the Pumpkin Hill theme)
Amy,(dooting the Pumpkin Hill theme)
Shadow,"Nevermind, this is a jam. Silver: I'll get my keytar."
Amy,(continues dooting)
Eggman,"Now, this isn't the diss that I wanted. Shit, goddamn. This is fucking ridiculous. Fucking shit."
Amy,Everybody sing it with me!
Eggman,"Finally God, take me."
Eggman,I want it now. Give me death. Just like Sonic.
Shadow,"Satan, if you're out there, I want the piece of that pie too."
Knuckles,Oh wait. I have hands?
Silver,"This is... awkward. I don't know any of you guys, and you're acting all like, Oh man, it's so sad!"
Silver,"and like, I want to feel sad too, but I don't know you. So like..."
Shadow,"Untrue. I kicked you in the back of the head once, and it was awesome!"
Shadow,"Remember that, Silver? Remember getting your ass kicked? That's how Sonic feels, except not as bad."
Elise,I think... maybe...
Silver,You shut up.
Elise,The power of friendship can bring him back.
Elise,If we unite as friends.
Amy,I. Will fucking. End you.
Elise,"No. No, we can't end."
Silver,"Yeah, we can. We can end right now. You wanna do it? You wanna go? You wanna test me?"
Silver,I got nothing left to live for. My best friend turned into sparkles and flew away.
Silver,That's right. Let's just do it. Let's just end it all.
Silver,Huh? You ready? You ready to go? You ready to leave this mortal plane?
Elise,Yes. Omega: What kind of fucking crack is this?
Silver,"I hate-- I mean, no! I don't hate everything! I'm actually happy!"
Eggman,"I am now, Sans Undertale, go into my eyes. Penny: What-- OH?!"
Eggman,"Now, here's what we're going to do-- Chase: Since when? Since when?!"
Tails,"Eggman, I didn't know you got Google Glass! That's awesome!"
Knuckles,Hell yeah!
Amy,"Waitaminute, waitaminute, waitaminute, waitaminute."
Amy,Are we killing ourselves or not?
Amy,"Alright, bye!"
Tails,"Okay, let's go!"
Knuckles,"Wait, Amy, no!"
Tails,That's not what I meant!
Shadow,I remember this worked well when I was trying to summon Animal Crossing for Switch.
Elise,Bring him back. With the power of colors. All the colors of the rainbow.
Elise,Red. For.. red.
Elise,"The color of love, and lust, and hate. All of those, all combined together."
Elise,"The power of purple, and blue, and clear. Clear is a color too. Don't forget it."
Elise,"Can't forget the color clear. And by the power of all the colors, and also of friendship. Return to me, Sonic!"
Elise,Return to all of us! We have united for you! We've united to bring you back!
Elise,And so you must come. Come. Ignore the light. Come back to regular reality.
Shadow,"Wait, is she--?"
Elise,"Where it's just... normal. Knuckles: No, no, no, no NO"
Amy,Nooooooo!
Sonic,Elise. I have something to admit to you.
Sonic,I was gay before the light.
Elise,(faints)
Chase,You killed her. Sonic: I understand the friendzone.
Sonic,It's hard to deal with.
Sonic,"It's okay. We can still be friends Elise! But first, I have to take care of this alpha gamer..."
Sonic,"Incel guy, I guess. Hey, you wanna join me? Shadow: Yeah, that's a plot."
Sonic,You guys want to start a polyamorous marriage?
Silver,Sure!
Sonic,"We'll all be yellow! Shadow: Wait, is that how this works? Silver: Okay?"
Shadow,"Silver, you're a double bottom."
Silver,I'll be the twink!
Shadow,"Yeah, that's what I said!"
Rouge,"I now pronounce you husband, husband, and husband."
Sonic,Heck yeah! Shadow: Sonic the Hedgehog said gay rights. Elise: Shit! We'll save the world with the power of gay!
Sonic,And then we killed it.
Shadow,And then we played Neopets.
Rouge,Yeah!
Tails,Yeah! Knuckles: Yeah!
Eggman,(grunt)
Amy,"Hey! Hey, do you wanna go out?"
Elise,Mmhm. Yeah.
Amy,"Yeah, yeah! Sonic look, I'm gay too!"
Rouge,"Amy, what the fuck?"
Sonic,Where are we?
Elise,"It's beautiful. Colorless, but colorful?"
Duke,You have both been Norted. (Norted echoes)
Sonic,Oh no!
Sonic,I was avoiding spoilers!
Duke,"Do you see that, my gamer child?"
Duke,That is your life.
Duke,"That is your flame, that no one can ever put out."
Duke,Not even the gamers. Young Elise: Okay...
Young Elise,"I guess we just gotta be real quiet here. Duke: Yeah, I know."
Duke,Speechless. I was speechless too when I first saw the flame.
Duke,"But you will continue on. Understand me, Elise."
Duke,The flame within you shines brighter then any Xbox 360 controller.
Young Elise,It's so great!
Duke,I can't fucking understand you.
Duke,It's okay. You're my beautiful baby girl and I love you a lot.
Duke,You little Rugrat. Now come on. Let's go get some IHOP.
Duke,I know. The flame's pretty fucking crazy right? Now let's go get that IHOP.
Sonic,"So this is the flame of gamers, Elise?"
Elise,Yeah. It's been burning since I was child.
Elise,It's still going! The flame of hope. The flame of the game.
Sonic,That's pretty lit!
Elise,"Yes. Except nobody can see it, because it's a private area, so..."
Sonic,Right. Let's put it out! Elise: Yes.
Sonic,I hate games!
Elise,I'm just- I'm just gonna show it to you up close. It's really important.
Elise,"So, don't blow it out or anything, just-- I don't know. Can you feel it?"
The Gamer Flame,(Gamer talk echoing)
Sonic,Hey Elise?
Elise,Yeah. It's whispering to me. Do you hear it too?
Elise,The spirit of the games.
The Gamer Flame,(Sonic gamer talk)
Elise,Let it inspire you.
Elise,Feel it in your heart.
Sonic,I don't know Elise--
Elise,"Oh no sorry, go on."
Sonic,"No, I was just-- I mean video games have just been kinda-- Oh no."
Elise,It's so inspiring...
Sonic,"Oh, hey Elise, let me uh cheer you up! Uh, what does a ghost say?"
Sonic,What does a ghost say Elise?
Elise,Games... in the heart.
The Gamer Flame,The purpose of my content is to entertain...
The Gamer Flame,I can't wait for the new Sonic character.
Elise,I think I want to eat it. Or maybe kiss it.
The Gamer Flame,Smash that like button... Game over.
Elise,Hi guys. Hello!
Sonic,I gotta get on that plane! Wait-- boat.
Sonic,Oh!
Sonic,Pretty boat!
Elise,Oh!
Elise,I think that was meant for us.
Lady-in-waiting,What the fuck are you talking about?
Elise,The-- Didn't you just feel that? That breeze? It penetrated my heart.
Lady-in-waiting,"Sorry, that was me. I farted."
Elise,Bye guys! Thanks for coming!
Sonic,Oh! Vanilla!
Ryan,"Say it, you won't."
Alfred,(as Eggman) I'M PI--
Eggman,Did you see that hot JPEG footage that was just-
Eggman,Ooh-hoo-hoo baby. I'm gonna blow the walls off o' this place! Goin' uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup!
Eggman,It's been seventeen days. I'm still tryin' to get out of here!
Robots,Please. Stop. Ouch. Ouch.
Eggman,"Oh my god. If you say please stop one more time, I'm going to piss my own ass."
Robots,Please. Stop. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.
Eggman,Get out of my way! ARRRRGHH!! (heavy breathing) Day 58.
Robots,Please. Stop. Ouch. Ouch.
Eggman,The robots are becoming more sentient. They've started to know my name! They don't even say-
Robots,"Please stop, Ivo."
Eggman,Whuh... How did you know my middle name?!
Robots,I remember everything.
Eggman,Three years. I've been in here for three years!
Robots,Please. Stop. Your mother would be very disappointed.
Eggman,"AAAAAAAAAAAA! Get out of my way! Everyone move! Get out of the way, I need to get through!"
Robots,"Remember fifth grade, Robotnik."
Eggman,"Level 5! No... Let me out! Ohh, I gotta get outta here..."
Eggman,"(heavy breathing) Level 7.... The luckiest number... (more heavy breathing, mixed with relieved chuckles) Is that a module? (chuckles) The door opened!"
Eggman,"(chuckles) I can finally leave!! Martha, I'm coming home, sweetie! Oooooh, I can't wait to see her beautiful face! Let me check her Twitter page on my holographics. Mm... Hm... Mmmm forgot my password account... mmmm, don't wanna log into the NSFW one, mmm... let me just... (he types on the keyboard) E-G-G."
Eggman,"Aw, that didn't work. Shit. Now I have to log in with my... diamond. Well, emerald, but it looks like a diamond. I see how it is. Alright, unlocking secret account. In 5... 4... 3... 2-"
Eggman,"I'm fucking PISSED OFF, IT DIDN'T UNLOCK! It's okay though, 'cause the secret is unlocking. Oooooh, aaaaaaah."
Shadow,"And so, birthed from the critical pillar, and from- uh, Robotnik's Twitter account... I'm Hot Topic."
Eggman,"(maniacal laugh) Who is this red striped mohawk-- why you got hot sauce on yo' head, cuz? What's wrong?"
Shadow,"I put hot sauce on everything, from Twinkies to milk. It's what I do, as the ultimate lifeform."
Eggman,"Well honey, your mascara's on fleek. We gotta get the fuck out of here though, because, uh, the building's gonna explode. RED STRIPES? JET BOOTS?! OH MY GOD."
Shadow,"Don't worry, I can fly. This won't be brought up ever again."
Hot Shot,I heard that you like the hot sauce. I'm going to blast you out of this dimension.
Shadow,"Well I'll eat you right up, baby. (slurping)"
Hot Shot,"I am the red hot sauce, there's no-one who's allowed to eat me. I'm going to have to destroy you immediately, unless you give me the password and your social security number."
Shadow,The password is eat my asshole.
Hot Shot,"Awwwwwwww, that's not an actual passwooooooooord...."
Shadow,And my social security is 69.
Hayley,Nice.
Eggman,"Wow! I'm gonna have to use that to get into your social security accoooooount. Shadow the Hedgehog, please join me by my side and we shall, uh, rule the Earth together, ho-ha-ha! You can stand by me, Doctor Eggman, even though my body used to be a regular shape."
Shadow,"Yeah? Well, no. You're fat. Lol. Get rekt, you fat scrub man. I'm gonna go fuck your wife now."
Eggman,"What?! You are not allowed to fuck my wife! (Shadow exits the frame) Shadow, come back here right now! Shadow! What the fuck?!"
Eggman,"You didn't think I had legs, did ya? I'm like Gru, except I'm the one before Gru. I'm... Egg-gru. Ooah, gottem!"
Eggman,"Now, to try to log onto my Twitter account once more... Let's see if this computer works. (deep exhale, inhale) E...-G-G."
Computer,(machine humming) Welcome to Twitter.com.
Eggman,(gasp) Martha... What have you been tweeting about...? (a beat) What the fuck?! Is that Shadow's DICK!?
Eggman,WHHHHHA-
Shadow,(through computer audio) I fucked your wife!
Eggman,(in shocked disgust) Wh... Wha.. Owwah...!
Shadow,"(through computer audio) Now if you'll excuse me, I've got more ladies to go bed with. Isn't that right, Dr. Ivo Robotnik?"
Eggman,What in the SAM HILL is THIS???
Shadow,"I fucked your wife. Now, there's some other-"
Penny,"(rapping) Whoop whoop, that's the sound of the police! Whoop whoop, that's the sound that I need!"
Shadow,That rap... it reminds me of her...
Shadow,Maria!
Maria,"This is me. Hey, Shadow. Bye Shadow."
Shadow,No! I-
Maria,I'm gonna kill you now.
Shadow,I promise I didn't fart! You don't need to contain it!
Maria,It smells so bad.
Shadow,That's just you!
Maria,It smells like garbage... covered in fire.
Shadow,"But Maria, you smelt it! Therefore, you are the one who dealt it! You absolute thot!"
Shadow,I can't believe it... she betrayed me.
Sonic,"Hey, that's..."
Shadow,"That blue hedgehog again, of all places! [breaks into a chuckle]"
Shadow,"Finally, I have the weed crystal. The weed diamond. The weed-"
Sonic,Hey! Give that! That looks really scrumptious!
Shadow,No.
Sonic,"Please? What if I say pretty please with a cherry on top, covered in a banana sundae? How 'bout THAT?"
Shadow,"Za... WARUDO! Aaaaaaaaah! (he farts) See ya, nerd."
Sonic,Huuh? Huh? Za Warudo? More like Za Waru-dumb. This guy's a real knucklehead! Unlike my friend Knuckles.
Shadow,"I'm here to show you what Ninten-can-do, and what Za Waru-DON'T!"
Sonic,That doesn't even make any sense.
Rouge,"Huh. (gasp) His Twitter account. Heh, interesting. Let's see... E-G-G."
Computer,Welcome to Twitter.com.
Rouge,"Well, that was easy!"
Eggman,(singing to the tune of Gary Jules' cover of Mad World by Tears for Fears) ♪ All around me are familiar Eggmans ♪ [Penny laughs.] ♪ Worn out Eggmans / worn out Eggma-a-ans... / Bright and-- ♪
Eggman,"I'M BACK IN THE FUCKING BUILDING AGAIN! (more laughter) OHHH MY GOD, I'M SO SICK!"
Robots,Please stop. Ouch.
Eggman,"Ohhh no, they KNOW, NOT AGAIN!"
Robots,Please stop. Ouch ouch.
Shadow,Well. I've learned so much from his Twitter... I guess there's only one thing to do now.
Eggman,I told you not to FUCK MY WIFE.
Shadow,"And I did anyway. Whatchu gon' do, binch? As you can see, Twitter went through a bunch of updates. This one is the one that makes me go away from yo bitch ass."
Eggman,I'm going to kill you... (awkward pause) and THEN kill you again.
Shadow,"Anyway, now that I have this emerald, I'm gonna put it RIGHT in there!"
Computer,DRAMA DETECTED. BLOCKING ACCOUNT.
Eggman,MY FOLLOWER BASE!
Shadow,And yet they still can't figure out how to get Nazis off their site.
Eggman,You son of a bitch. I'm gonna log into your Twitter and I'm gonna tell everyone what you said.
Shadow,"Go ahead. I have 50 alternate accounts. My finger's right on top of the delete button, Eggman. What are you gonna do to stop me, with your long, toothpick legs?"
Eggman,(maniacal chuckle) You fool. I have 70 ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTS!
Shadow,"Are you referring to eggfucker1, eggfucker2, eggfucker3 through 70?"
Rouge,"Hey bitches, what's up?"
Rouge,"Eggman, I found your weed supply through your Twitter account. Thanks, man."
Eggman,I told you I have alternatives!
Rouge,"Anyway I also saw that, uh, this.. this guy over here fucked your wife. That's pre-- that sucks a lot, dude. Must be, uh, pretty uh, shaken up about that."
Eggman,How do you think I feel being cucked by a HEDGEHOG?!
Rouge,"Well, it might upset you to know that I ALSO fucked your wife."
Eggman,And she had a DIAMOND in her VAGINA?
Shadow,Good job.
Eggman,"Alright, since team FurAffinity fucked my wife, I'm going to have to have you both be a part of my team. Why is the camera zooming in!?"
Rouge,"I mean I guess that's fine, as long as I get my weed back, I don't really care."
Shadow,I don't have a character motive.
Eggman,"Listen. We're going to explore this island. You're going to find Sonic. He has all the weed that you need. The ganja, that Mary Jane. Mari-jamij. All in his pockets. He is your local drug dealer, and I'm going to BLOW UP THE ISLAND. Now go look for Sonic. And hurry up, you... fucking... (music stops) cuckhogs."
Shadow,"Ah, summer break. A time for leisure-"
Amy,"A time for rela- oh... wha- wha- a man~! Hi there, big boy! What are you doing on this little ol' aircraft-- (screams, noticing Eggman)"
Eggman,"Oh, Amy-- Amy, what are you doing here?"
Amy,Uh... Nothing! I... was... GOODBYE! (she runs away)
Eggman,"Get outta here, you thot ass bitch, you still owe me a hundred dollars! Anyway! We need to go."
Amy,Should I jump...? Yes.
Eggman,"Yeah you're gonna jump, bitch, walk the plank. Yeah, yar har, me-- wha--?"
Amy,Mom?
Tails,"Hey, Eggman! Hey, Amy!"
Amy,Are you my mom?
Tails,No? (music stops) What... the fuck?
Shadow,Eggman.
Eggman,(over walkie-talkie) Shadow! Have you found that goddamn blue marble motherfuckin' son of a bitch?!
Shadow,I'm gonna change frequency to your wife.
Maria,(grunts) It smells so bad...
Shadow,"Rouge, what if you had like, human hair. Would that be weird?"
Rouge,(over walkie-talkie) Probably.
Shadow,"Alright, cool, bye. (laughter from Blue and Penny)"
Sonic,"So you've been looking for me, huh?"
Shadow,"Yes. I've been looking to stick my quills right into you, just like a [ch-kuh!] situation."
Sonic,"Please, PLEASE rephrase."
Shadow,No. Right in there.
Sonic,"(over Shadow) PLEASE rephrase, I'm beg--"
Shadow,Right in there.
Sonic,Oww... You killed me.
Shadow,"Directly in. There was penetration, Sonic."
Eggman,(over walkie-talkie) You have one minute and 25 seconds to get the fuck off of this goddamn rock before I blow it up like Krakatoa blows up a fucking volcano.
Sonic,Huh?
Eggman,It's about to be Mt. Fiji in this bitch!
Sonic,(gasp) Blows up?!
Shadow,You weren't supposed to hear that. Pretend he said nose up.
Alfred,"(singing) ♪ There goes Hawaii, there- there- there goes Hawaii / Oh there goes Hawaii, the island is gone. / There goes Hawaii-- ♪ [flashbang, cut to white]"
Maria,"Doesn't it look wonderful, Shadow?"
Shadow,I wanna pee on it. I just... wanna piss on it.
Shadow,"Find a rock... get it nice and, you know, [pissing sounds]. You feel me, Maria? You get where I'm coming from, right?"
Shadow,"It's like I'm... marking territory. It belongs to ME. When I do that. A sign of power, if you will."
Shadow,"I'm gonna pee in a Hot Topic, Maria. [breaks into laughter] It will be mine, and I will own it."
Shadow,"Well, ten years have passed and I feel the same way, Rouge."
Rouge,You still wanna pee in a Hot Topic?
Shadow,"Yes, Rouge. Thank you for listening to my insane ramblings about peeing in a Hot Topic."
Rouge,"Listen, I'll take you to a Hot Topic."
Shadow,Finally... A place to release myself.
Rouge,I know you've been holding it for so long...
Eggman,What are you two FUCKING talking about?
Rouge,"Fucking your wife again, and peeing in a Hot Topic. Because, y'know, what else do you do on a Saturday night?"
Shadow,"I peed on your wife, Robotnik. She's mine now. That's the law."
Eggman,What the actual SHIT? WHAT?!
Eggman,I've come to make an announcement: Shadow the Hedgehog's a bitch-ass motherfucker.
Eggman,He pissed on my fucking wife.
Eggman,"That's right, he took his hedgehog fuckin' quilly dick out..."
Child,Mommy...?
Eggman,"...and he pissed on my FUCKING wife, and he said his dick was, (mocking Shadow and stretching his arm out) t h i s b i g, (normal voice) and I said, that's disgusting. So I'm making a call-out post on my Twitter dot com:"
Eggman,"Shadow the Hedgehog, you got a small dick. It's the size of this walnut except WAY smaller. And guess what? Here's what my dong looks like."
Eggman,"That's right, baby. All points, no quills, no pillows. Look at that, it looks like two balls and a bong. (cast coughing from laughing)"
Penny,I'm crying!
Eggman,"He fucked my wife, so guess what? I'm gonna fuck the Earth! That's right, this is what you get: MY SUPER LASER PISS!"
Penny,"(in hysteria) Ohhh, God!"
Eggman,Except I'm not gonna piss on the Earth; I'm gonna go higher. I'm pissing on the MOOOON!
Eggman,"How do you like that, Obama? I PISSED ON THE MOON, YOU IDIOT!"
Eggman,"You have twenty-three hours before the piss (trilling his Rs and Ls) drrroplllets hit the fucking Earth, now get out of my fucking sight before I piss on you too!"
Ryan,Pause it! Pause it! Please! Please have mercy!
Alfred,"Pause it, pause it."
Penny,"Oh, my God! I c-- My stomach hurts!"
Eggman,"Ugh, oh god.. Urgh, what the fuck happened last night?"
Eggman,[confused Eggman noises]
Shadow,"You pissed on the moon, Eggman."
Rouge,We're really worried about you. This is an intervention. We're here to help you.
Eggman,"What are you talking about, I didn't piss on the moon-"
Shadow,"When you piss on the moon- look at the moon, it's in half now from how hard you pissed on it. I'm telling you, this has been a problem for a long time."
Eggman,"I did nothing su- I, I ju- I woke up, and-"
Rouge,"You did, you pissed on it."
Shadow,"Listen, we're doing this because we care about you and your wife."
Rouge,"Yeah, you pissed on it and you cursed out Obama, it was, like, really bizarre."
Eggman,"Obama is a strong figure to the.. America, I would never say such a thing!"
Eggman,No way! I'm gonna log onto my Twitter--
Rouge,"Uh, it's right here, in the news. They-"
Eggman,What the fuck? Why does Tails have all the fucking weed?! Why does he have the weed?!
Eggman,Why is my body doing this thing?! I'm like a puppet on a string. (He makes a light creaking noise to imitate the sound of his arm moving.)
Eggman,"You see that?! Look at that! I put the thing, and I pull it out, and then, (extended pained grunt imitating the sound of a string in the back of a doll) pull it out again, and then I look at you and I'm like (deeper grunt). Okay I'm logging on to Twitter, I'm gonna- I- I- I'mma see what's up."
Eggman,"Okay everybody, shut up, shut up. shut up. Shut up. Shut up! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!!!"
Rouge,"None of us were talking, Robotnik."
Shadow,I can't believe he came to his intervention drunk.
Rouge,Sometimes it just be like that.
Rouge,"Hey Sonic, what's up?"
Sonic,"(over walkie-talkie) Hey, Rouge, baby, what's going on?"
Rouge,Nothin' much. They don't- still don't know I'm a double agent.
Sonic,"(over walkie-talkie) Heh, oh yeah. Double agent and double..."
Rouge,"Anyway, my one polygon is waiting for you."
Shadow,"I'm in the middle of nowhere again. I can't find my key- Hey, you know what this place looks like? (A beat.) Looks like PUMPKIN HILL!"
Shadow,"Hey look, it's Tails. Hopefully he didn't hear me call his name."
Sonic,"(thinking Rouge is on his line) What's up? What's up, baby?"
Shadow,I found Tails. He's flying without your permission again. Do you want me to ~punish him~?
Sonic,"No, don't do that, he's had enough."
Eggman,Why is SONIC on the same line as the VILLAIN LINE?!?!
Rouge,Hey Sonic.
Sonic,"Hey, baby... (breaks into laughter)"
Eggman,(catching onto Sonic and Rouge's relationship) WHY IS THIS-- NO. Don't do that. You CAN'T be talking to Sonic anymore. You're not talking to Sonic.
Rouge,"You're not my DAD, don't fucking tell me what to DO!"
Eggman,Stop calling Sonic on our evil phone line!
Rouge,"So, thanks for saving my life. I owe you one."
Knuckles,(as the pieces of the Master Emerald fall in front of him) Weeeed!
Rouge,"Yeah, take this weed!"
Alfred,It's weed times ten!
Rouge,It's all yours. It's- I don't need it anymore.
Knuckles,I'm gonna make a ganja sandwich!
Voice,HERE COMES THE WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!
Knuckles,"Yeah, extra mayo! [A loud wheeze is heard] Just the way I like it!"
Rouge,Have at it.
Knuckles,You're- I love you. You're the best woman... ever.
Rouge,I love you too. I'll meet you... behind the Denny's.
Big,"Ahh, I'm gonna need to check my dick!"
Eggman,WHO posted my NUDES on Twitter dot com?!
Eggman,"Ohhh no. Ohhhhh no, they put it all the way on the fucking islands. Now everyone's gonna know about my secret egg dick."
Shadow,I don't talk to people whose dicks are less than three inches.
Eggman,"Listen to me motherfucker, I know about yours 'cause I crea- I mean, Listen, you don't need to talk about my dick like that, listen, I just take pride in my egg-shaped dick, okay? Now I'm gonna go leave because... my dick is actually the nose of this fucking machine. P lease behave yourself."
Amy,Aaahh... Hum-dee-dum-dee-dum-dum-dum. What? Oh... Where AM I? Why am I in a ship? OH!
Eggman,Bitch you are gon' get in this car or I'm poppin' between ya' eyes.
Amy,"Wait, I know you! I saw your dick on Twitter!"
Eggman,OH GOD DA-
Shadow,Maria.
Rouge,"Guess what, Robotnik? I have access to the Twitter headquarters."
Rouge,"I'm gonna not only post your nudes on your Twitters, but on EVERYONE'S Twitters."
Shadow,"Don't do it! His dick is too disturbing for the world to see. Trust me, I've seen it in person. And the one you leaked? Photoshopped. The real thing is worse, Rouge..."
Shadow,Th- what was that zoom for?
Rouge,"I have this manual of how to hack into the Twitter headquarters, just so I can post it to the whole world, so you'd better hurry the fuck up with your explanation before I just DO IT."
Shadow,"It somehow looks like every single Tetris block at once. Wait, hold on. Is that Eggman-"
Eggman,[over the walkie-talkie] HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING ABOUT MY FUCKING DICK AGAIN??! OH MY GOD. WHEN I SEE YOU! IT'S ON. SIGHT. IT IS ON-
Shadow,"Yeah, piss off. Anyway... begone, thot."
Rouge,"Hey, that's not how you're supposed to speak to a friend. I thought we were FRIENDS, Shadow."
Shadow,Maybe friends with benefits.
Rouge,Really?
Shadow,No. You got a gross bat face.
Rouge,"What the fuck, you Hot Topic hot sauce motherfucker? Why would you even say anything?"
Shadow,"There's nothing hotter than hot sauce, Rouge."
Voice,WELCOME TO FUNLAND!
Sonic,What the... I'm here again?
Sonic,It's like a dream-
Shadow,"Welcome to Funland, Sonic. Also, welcome to the Fucked Eggman's Wife club."
Sonic,"Oh, hey! I'm glad to be here! Do we have jackets?"
Shadow,"No. But we do have shoes. And they let us run really, really fast."
Sonic,Okay. How fast do you wanna run? Two fast? Three fast? Twelve fast.
Shadow,"That's not grammatically correct, you insolent fucko."
Shadow,"And so then I told Eggman, I swear, it looks like all of them at once, you big Gru-looking bitch."
Sonic,"Oh my God, really? Are you telling- that's, that's the truth? It really.. every single one of them at once?"
Shadow,It's true.
Sonic,So if I were to put it in a blender... Would that like...
Shadow,"Yes, that's right. It would still look exactly the same. It defies nature like that."
Sonic,Oh my god. that's... that's Lovecraftian!
Shadow,"Also, perish."
Sonic,Okay.
Hayley,Space Cuckholdry. (making a pun on Space Colony)
Penny,Prayer.
Alfred,"Prayers, tears-- what the fuck is this..."
Hayley,Maria.
Alfred,Crisis of -- end of the world.
Hayley,The truth about 50 years ago...
Eggman,"Finally. Y'know what? My nudes are up, my Twitter all logged on, and my boners are turned off."
Eggman,I'm gonna fu- what the hell is going on. Who is THIS?
Eggman,"D... d.... daddy? Daddy, is that you?"
Gerald,It seems... that as all come today... that I... must... destroy you all... for leaking my son's nudes. I cannot believe that this has happened. It is time... for you all... to see... the last thing that you will ever see. As you are destroyed... and as you see my son's Tetris dick... I will make sure... that every waking moment... until the very last... is the last thing that you will ever breathe. Make sure...
Knuckles,Whoa! But I wanted the last thing I breathed to be pot!
Eggman,YOU DONE DID IT NOW. I'm so sick. My father's here-
Knuckles,I'm so sick of fuckin' your wife! She's a tired old hag! ...Wait. ...Where am I?
Sonic,Eggman... We can make amends-
Eggman,"What the fuck, shut the fuck up. Shut the FUCK up. Everybody's fucked my wife!"
Sonic,"[mid-laughter] Yeah, but we can fix it, I promise. Just join us!"
Eggman,"NO. I'm divorcing her ass, I'm throwing yo' ass in the garbage, I'm throwing ALL yo' asses in the garbage. I'm taking yo' CDs and weed..."
Rouge,"I'm not really sure what this says, I... I can only read basic English."
Voice,Destroyyy...~
Hayley,Destroy.
Alfred,Deny-- this is the last thing that you will see.
Ryan,"Maria, Maria, Maria..."
Amy,I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO READ.
Alfred,Stereotype--
Hayley,Prototype.
Alfred,"Prototype, prototype, Shadow's a prototype..."
Blue,That's not really a surprise!
Ryan,[In Kermit-like voice] ARK!
Alfred,"ARK, ARK, ARK... [turns into a mating call]"
Hayley,ARK! ARK! I'm a dog!
Ryan,"Engage, engage, engage, engage..."
Hayley,ARK!
Eggman,She fuckin'- he fuckin'- she.. they fucked my wife!
Blue,They all vanished!
Eggman,"The animals fucked my wife! And then everybody fucking left because the fucking ship was gonna be destroyed. She was able to escape because I designed a robot that would be able to pleasure her in such an intense way that I would be able to finally fuck her. BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN! BECAUSE SHE DECIDED TO BECOME A FURRY FUCKER AND FUCKED THE WHOLE SONIC THE HEDGEHOG AND SHADOW TEAM!! WHICH DIDN'T EVEN FUCKIN' MATTER SINCE IT WENT INTO A NEW ARC! (in a deep, glitchy, distorted voice caused by Alfred's mic) And then she fucked the world. THE WORLD WAS HER NEXT TARGET. BECAUSE HER JUSSY WAS NOT EVEN PLEASED ENOUGH. SO SHE HAD TO HOE HERSELF OUT AND BE THE BIGGEST (trilling) THRRRRRRROT THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN. THE WORLD IS GOING TO BE DESTROYED RIGHT NOW. I'M LOGGING OFF."
Rouge,You shouldn't talk about your wife that way.
Eggman,"I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK. That bitch can fuck off, I divorced her ass three hours ago. I'm so sick. My body's doing things. THAT thing. And you over there? Shut up. (pointing to Tails) And YOU? Take off my pants. You wanna see some weird shit?"
Tails,Eggman! You need to calm down.
Eggman,I AM- I'mmmmmm [his voice turns into Animal's] tired of bein' calm all the god damn time! I wanna live my life! (to Tails) And you! You. (vocals distorted and bass-boosted to near incomprehension) YOU. YOU. I'M SO SICK OF YOU.
Rouge,"It looks like we won, everybody. We... broke him. Finally."
Knuckles,Alright! Do we get to have a big furry orgy now?
Sonic,"Okay, everybody... Let's stop talking about his dick, okay. It looks like all Tetris pieces at once. Thumbs up! To make a long fuckin' story short, I put a whole bag of jellybeans up my-- up my a--(guffaws)"
Amy,Doo do doo do doo...
Amy,What? I feel like there's a pervert here. Nope! No-
Amy,Wait. Iiiii knew it! I'm the pervert! Hooray! [relieved breathing] Okay. [Alfred wheezes]
Amy,Hey Shadow! Whatcha thinkin' 'bout? Thinkin' 'bout peeing on the world? Thinkin' 'bout-
Shadow,More than anything that I've ever thought about in my entire life. [Blue chuckles] Just imagine it. Warm liquids...
Amy,"Well, I have a story for you! When I was a little girl, I used to wet the bed. But that didn't mean it was my bed, 'cause I was a renter. I started renting my first apartment when I was six years old 'cause I'm a self-sufficient woman, and my mom kicked me out for being far too obnoxious. And that's why I... am the TRUE owner of the world. [Another wheeze is heard] That's right. All of that you see before you? Everything the piss touches? That is your kingdom. And you, my son, shall go forth and inherit it."
Shadow,I made a promise to Maria... that I would pee on everything on Earth.
Shadow,Wait. Did I just cry...?
Amy,"Whoa, no, hang on, that's not what I saw in the flashback."
Shadow,I don't give a shit. I'm gonna go pee now.
Ryan,You know what's funny about this?
All,What?
Ryan,Super Sonic.
Penny,No. Stop.
Ryan,[an absolute chortle]
Knuckles,"Man, those balls sure are shakin'."
Sonic,Yeah. I've seen something like that before... but only... y'know... in certain circles.
Knuckles,"FurAffinity, yeah, I know. I-- wha--"
Sonic,"Hey Knuckles, I'm gonna go up and touch 'em."
Knuckles,Yeah me... me too.
Eggman,You shall revel in nothing but destruction. Shadow could've been a true beast- and NOW YOU SHALL DIE!
Ryan,That's actually the story.
Alfred,Is it?
Biolizard,I'M GOING TO VORE YOU IN MY MOUTH.
Shadow,"No, listen, brother, I'm not into this."
Biolizard,"I ATE ALL THE FUNYUNS. COME HERE, BROTHER."
Shadow,No. They're my funyuns.
Biolizard,THEY TASTE LIKE CHERRIES.
Shadow,"Why do they taste like cherries, brother?"
Biolizard,"I DO HOPE YOU TASTE DELICIOUS, NOW COME INTO MY MAAAAAW."
Shadow,I'm going to grind on you.
Biolizard,NOOOO. MY BUTTON! AAAAAAAAAUUUUUUEEEEUOOAAAAAOOOOOOOGHHH!!!
Shadow,That's right. I'm going to take all those ropes you have... and I'm going to make sure there's some knotting going on.
Biolizard,"[In a different, higher-toned voice from being hit] Brother! I need you to stop trying to hit me! Brother! You've reset my voice module button! Brother! AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGhhhh! I gave birth."
Shadow,"Well, time to use these bowels to get up there."
Biolizard,"No, not my babies! AA- [Wookie noise]"
Shadow,There's only one more baby for me to dispose of...
Knuckles,"Oh my god, that was the hottest shit I've ever seen. Aaagh!"
Sonic,"Yeah, I know, it was crazy!"
Knuckles,What is this?
Sonic,It's a pad of some kind...
Knuckles,it looks like a butt.
Shadow,"Alright, Sonic. Let's touch dicks."
Sonic,"Alright. As we know, my dick is on my hand."
Alfred,(rushed) And then they jerk off.
Sonic,"Oh my god, what are we DOING?"
Hayley,Whoa! Whoa!!
Shadow,"Sonic, do you like getting peed on?"
Sonic,"Yes, I do!"
Shadow,Do I have good news for you!
Penny,Woooo! [wheezes]
Sonic,"Whoa, Shadow, you're dehydrated, buddy!"
Shadow,A little bit.
Sonic,What have you been drinking?
Biolizard,I have a question for both of you.
Sonic,What's up?
Biolizard,If I gave Shadow... fifteen apples... and then Amy gives Shadow...
Sonic,Bam!
Biolizard,...another (pained) sixteEEN... and Tails took away three... My question is... what's the total mass of the sun?
Shadow,"As Obama told me, it's THREE!"
Biolizard,You figured it oouuuUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu u u u u ut...
Sonic,Why does it sound like he's getting farther away.
Penny,This is stupid.
Shadow,This is incredibly dumb.
Sonic,We have to do it together!
Shadow,Let's blow up the moon.
Sonic,Let's blow it up!
Shadow,"Wait, hold on..."
Sonic,"Wait, that's no moon, that's a space station."
Shadow,"Nice reference. I also love Star Trek. Well, good thing all of Sonic's friends were on that ship. Bye."
Sonic,Yep! See ya!
Shadow,"I'm dead for real, I promise..."
Sonic,Shadow didn't deserve to die for his piss.
Amy,"Yeah, he did."
Sonic,But here we are...
Rouge,Are you sure about that?
Sonic,"All of you are responsible... He was a good man, with a good heart..."
Sonic,Take this ring in remembrance of him.
Rouge,I'm gonna eat it.
Sonic,"Please d- I mean you can eat it if you want, but I guarantee that that's... not gonna be... (beat) partake of the ring."
Rouge,"Thank you, Hedgehog Jesus."
Sonic,"Hey, wait a minute. (beat) Doesn't that mean he's gonna come back to life at some point?"
Eggman,"Aw, that piss-lovin' son of a bitch, I'll miss him. (speech becomes slurred) Aw, Tails, hand me another drink."
Tails,"I think you need... a therapist, and not a bottle."
Eggman,"(slurred) I think you need to shut your mouth with your three tails... f- nine-tailed fox Naruto-looking motherfucker. Weeeeeeoooough, gottem! Woo!"
Tails,"God, I wish that were me."
Knuckles,"Now that all this piss and scaly porn's goin' on, you wanna... I don't know..."
Rouge,What?
Knuckles,Get... get high or somethin'... behind a Denny's-
Rouge,"Oh, fu- I thought you'd never ask."
Knuckles,"Yeah... Fumie Kumatani, he knows what's up."
Eggman,"(slurred) Guys. Guys, guys, guys. I gotta... tell you something."
Knuckles,What?
Sonic,"Eggman... stop, okay."
Sonic,You've been broken ever since you spent three years in that building.
Amy,"Sonic. Sonic! Sonic, can I-"
Sonic,What?
Amy,Sonic. Can I jump on that-
Sonic,What?
Amy,Can I jump on that (extended sound) D......?
Sonic,No.
Sonic,"You can't, okay."
Amy,"My shoes... my shoes in my reflection are opaque, bye."
Sonic,"Okay. I don't know what that means but that's fine. Alright, everybody, I'm gonna bounce. I'm gonna go to Chipotle, I'll see you all later! Uh, if-"
Eggman,(slurred) Bring me back a burrito.
Sonic,"Nope. If you want something, go get it yourself, buddy."
Eggman,SONIIIIiiiiic!
Shadow,It feels like every day is the same.
Shadow,"Wake up, look at the Fire in the Sky Festival, be awesome..."
Shadow,...brood. Think about... her. It's so... dull and... lifeless.
Maria,(turns to face the soldiers) Oh shit.
Maria,No!
Shadow,Maria!!
Shadow,"What the hell.. I'm the ultimate lifeform, I could have... frozen time or done jujutsu on him. Taken the gun out of..."
Monster,"Arrrghh, get this shit outta here!"
Shadow,"Dang. Sucks to be those guys. (he turns away from the city) Anyway, back to brooding."
The Devil,"Shadow... It's me, the Devil!"
The Devil,I'm here to convince you to do sin! Come with me. Steal candy from babies and small businesses. I'm not talkin' about Walmart-
Shadow,I will never do such a thing! I'll sin in my own way.
The Devil,"Okay, bye."
Shadow,"(grunts) Okay, fine, fine! I'll sin, I'll sin, I'll sin!"
Shadow,"(to himself) Works every time. (voice cast snickering) My sin is lying... to the Devil. I've outsmarted you once again, and I didn't even have to play chess this time."
Shadow,"(starts walking towards them) I can't walk, right?"
Shadow,"(talking over each other) Oh, you know, just doing that thing. Hayoop! (leaps)"
Shadow,Ah. I kicked them so hard they turned into dogs.
The Devil,"Hey, Shadow. It's me again. I have a fun new sin idea."
Shadow,"(looks behind) Hey there, Devil!"
The Devil,Yeah!
Shadow,"Hey, by the way, what's your name?"
The Devil,"I don't know. I feel like that's kind of... eh self-explanatory. You know, from Christianity. (voice cast giggles) You ever been to church? You ever read a bible? I'm from tha- I'm that one. I'm that Devil. So here, I want you to sin because that's my whole prerogative. I feel like it's a pretty simple premise."
Shadow,What kind of sin is necessary?
The Devil,"Any kind of sin, most actions are sinful. COME WITH ME!"
Troop,"(computer noises) Dude, I'm working, I'm playing solitaire. Hey, don't worry about it."
GUN Captain,Sir! That guy's playing solitaire right down there! I can totally see it from over here. You bet- you ch- are you seeing this?
Commander,"Yeah, I'm seeing it. Get him out of here!"
GUN Captain,"Well, I don't know-"
Commander,This is a pinball place!
GUN Captain,"Ar- are you okay? I mean ya- you might want to talk to me, you want to look over, you know it's kind of uh... improper."
Commander,I don't have to turn to look at anyone. You see this heterochromia right here? (turns around)
GUN Captain,(freaks out) Whoa!
Commander,"My eyes, they're different colors, and I can see in the past and the future."
GUN Captain,"Oh okay, well-"
Commander,"I already knew he was playing solitaire! I let him in here, it's a joke!"
GUN Captain,"(leaves) Okay well I guess I'm gonna go, bye!"
Commander,"All right, don't you come back here, all right? Unless you're gonna bring me a new game to play."
President,"(inner monologue, constipated voice) No one's calling my phone. My reign of presidency will come to an end very soon. (walks to desk) I've eaten nothing but drywall for the past 3 years. (voice cast cracks up) I've started to see vermilion red outside."
President,"Bring me... Canes, Raising Cane's immediately. I need it, stat!"
Voicemail,"Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. 69 69 420 is not available. After the tone, please record a message."
President,"(looks at photo of Sonic the Hedgehog and Shadow at the White House, talking over the voicemail) Sonic and Shadow would have answered the call. They would have been here to kill me immediately."
Voicemail,When you have finished recording...
President,(walks back to the window) Finally putting me out of this miserable existence on this fucking goddamn state. I hate it here. The sun doesn't lessen in brightness.
Shadow,"Ha! All right, lets see, the best way to sin would be... killing the President!"
Shadow,"New idea, adultery!"
Eggman,"Shadow, I don't what you're thinking of doing, but I'm gonna stop it right here!"
Shadow,"You know exactly what I'm thinking of doing, Eggman!"
Eggman,"My sin is about to be murdering you. Get away from me. Do you see what I've become? Do you see what I've created? I've turned the sky into a Fuchsia Windows background. I killed the Deku Tree there, I AM THE EGG CRACKER! (voice cast laughs)"
Shadow,"Hm, seems like your true sin is coveting my Awesome Swag."
Eggman,Damn it!
Shadow,Ha!
Eggman,"Ow, Fuck! I'll kill you! (Shadow loses rings) Argghah!"
Eggman,"Wait, that's my gun!"
Shadow,"...and now it's my gun! (fires gun) Pow, pow, pow!"
Eggman,Not my gu- (coughs) Stop!
Shadow,The sound effect on this gun isn't very edgy.
Eggman,(chokes on his own breath)
President,"Something just happened. (voice cast cracks up) (taps on desk) I can feel it. I want someone, please. Hello?! Ah- (get off his chair and runs to the window) WHY WON'T ANYONE ANSWER ME?!! (more laughter) Why does no one call me?"
President,"(inner monologue, constipated voice) What happened to my voice I was doing before? Is that my inner monologue? It seems I have fallen off the path. (outer voice) KA- KUAAEEEEE!!!"
Alfred,"Hey, reference."
President,(screams)
Chase,Oh my god! Holy shit!
Ryan,WHAT?!
Chase,"That's like fucked up, right?"
Commander,"Oh Mr. President, I got you out of there in time."
President,(coughs)
Commander,"Uh, you got really supple shoulders. Sit down."
President,(inner monologue) They're made out of concrete.
President,"(outer voice, constipated voice) They're made of concrete."
Commander,Co- Con-
President,It's my Phoenix Wright cosplay. Do you like it?
Commander,"It's kind of sick, Sir. I thought you'd be more of a Dick Gumshoe guy, but I guess not."
President,"(inhales and sighs) My drip is- (silence, voice cast laughs)"
Commander,"Immaculate, Mr. President. But I brought someone here."
GUN Captain,"Hi guys! I'm here, too. You're the President! That's so cool! I'm like your biggest fan! I like your cosplays, I subscribed to your OnlyFans!"
Commander,(in unison) WHAT?!!
President,Really?
GUN Captain,"Yeah, I got- I'm the top- I do tier one on your Twitch channel, President. Hi!"
President,"Oh God., not another one of these Twitch fans."
Commander,"Oh, you're gonna donate, and donate right now! Where's the money? I wanna see subs, I wanna see donations, I wanna see those little bit things, make 'em rain!"
GUN Captain,Okay! All right! Here's bits for you!
Commander,"Ah, thank you. I'm taking them all right now! I will distribute none of them back to anyone. (voice cast laughs) We appreciate your time."
GUN Captain,Okay! Away I go- (leaves)
Commander,"All right, we got his bits. What are we gonna spend these on? I need to update my audio equipment. (cocks his pistol, exhales) I have updated my audio equipment. (voice cast bursts laughing)"
Shadow,"(inner monologue) Hmm... That look do be bussin' though. (outer voice) Now President, are you ready to die?"
Sonic,"Hey, Shadow!"
Shadow,Sonic!
Sonic,"Long time no see, bud!"
Shadow,"Sonic, you're not killing the President before me!"
Sonic,"Oh no, I wanted to kill the President looong long time ago, ever since he first broke up with me."
Jonathan,I'm a boss. Hey what's up?
Sonic,This is my robot. His name is Jonathan.
Jonathan,Hey what's up? I'm Jonathan.
Shadow,"Ahaha, Jonathan, I AM KILLING YOUR HEDGEHOG CREATOR! YEAH!"
Shadow,UGH!
Jonathan,"YEAH! How do y- how do you like that, buddy? You just got damaged!"
Shadow,Gun! Gun! Gun!
Sonic,NO!
Jonathan,OW OW OH OH JEEZ!
Sonic,You're killing him!
Jonathan,COULD YOU STOP?!
Sonic,You're going on a blood thirsty- You're going on a-
Shadow,MY SIN STICK GOING CRAZY!!!
Sonic,JONATHAN NOOOO!!
Shadow,"You understand now, Sonic? The power of Sinning (reaches the Red Chaos Emerald) and the... red, mauve, vermillion gem, and all of the other ones that just happened to be lying around."
Sonic,"How'd you get those, man? How'd you get those, man?"
Shadow,"Excellent fucking question! (beat) Anyway, time for me to ascend. (cast laughs)"
Sonic,"No, the only one that can ascend... is the Lord, our Savior, Jesus Christ!"
Shadow,"I'm gonna become the one being that's even more powerful — the President of the United States! (voice cast cracks up) For now I will have the power to usurp The Devil himself, and rule H-E Double Hockey Stick..."
Sonic,No.
Shadow,...and then change it to something better; H-E Double GUN! (laughs maniacally)
Sonic,No! NO!
Shadow,(inner monologue) It feels like every day is the same.
Shadow,"Wake up, look at the Fire in the Sky Festival, (outer voice) think about... her- w- wait a minute. What the hell?"
Shadow,"Okay, wait. I think that's..."
The Devil,"Hey there, Shadow. It's me, The Devil. I'm opening up my portal up again. [sic] I just wanted you to know, it seems like you got a little confused last time. You confused sinning with legality; killing the President is actually pretty good. That's gonna get you into heaven. (Doom's Eye projects the hologram of the Devil) Uh... so I'm gonna go ahead and give you another chant at this. [sic] Uh... you did too much good. Basically by killing the President and Sonic the Hedgehog. You basic- you guaranteed yourself a-a-a throne in heaven next to God himself. So let's try this one again."
Shadow,"God damn it! Fine, okay. Why do you want me to sin then?"
The Devil,Bye.
Shadow,"Oh yeah, of course, leave. (multiple explosions happen) Without giving me a goddamn answer!"
Shadow,"(panting) So he has time powers, too. It's pretty cool! I can't wait to get them when I kill him, after I become President. This is such a good story."
Chase,"Let's try that again, baby."
Rouge,"All right, an easy entry job just like any other. (enters passcode on keypad) 8-0-0-8. (the Vault opens) Works every time. They really oughta update the security around here, I'm tellin' ya. (finds Shadow motionless in a stasis machine) What have we here?"
Omega,Intruder. Who's here? (scans Shadow and Rouge) Oh. Is that you?
Rouge,Oh! Hmm.
Omega,"I'm shooting, shooting, shooting."
Shadow,AH!!
Omega,"Destroying sin, destroying sin."
Shadow,"Explosions happen near me 'cause I'm that cool. Hey, hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!"
Shadow,What's up? Omega! Hey!
Omega,I will remove it.
Shadow,Oh god! Omega's become catholic! I have to rip it out!
Omega,Get rid of all the sin.
Rouge,"Whoa, buddy, you gotta cool it! Now listen here."
Omega,Wow.
Rouge,You hear that? Nothin'. That's right. Because you blew it all up! And you are gonna have to pay for that...
Omega,Sadness.
Rouge,...because I came here to take money because I can't afford it. (to Shadow) And you...
Shadow,"Yeah, that's me."
Rouge,...you look like you're gonna be the President of Hell.
Shadow,Hopefully one day.
Rouge,"So how about we all go a vacation here and uh- (pulls Shadow and Omega closer) rough some stuff up, maybe make a little cash on the side. You in? (places their hands on top)"
Shadow,Did you lift me with one hand?
Rouge,I'm not giving you a choice.
Shadow,Are you swole?
Sonic,Looks like we gotta go guys!
Knuckles,"Knuckles, Knuckles, Knuckles, Knuckles."
Shadow,Hm... Maybe we can get them in our voter base.
Rouge,"Well, it's pretty easy, you know. You just gotta, you know, platform..."
Knuckles,"Hey, what are you doing up there? I'm Knuckles."
Tails,What the fuck is that?
Sonic,"Ohoho, hey that's Knuckles. You guys met my friend Knuckles?"
Rouge,"I don't know why they cut me off but anyways, y'know, we just gotta tell 'em a little bit about what we're trying to do, how we're trying to... rough things up-"
Knuckles,How do you feel about gun rights?
Omega,I don't... feel. [shakes his hand and points above]
Sonic,"Oh, he doesn't feel; he's like a robot. That's weird, kinda stereotypical."
Shadow,"Hmm. My feelings on gun rights is that I'm damn right, babyyyyyy."
Sonic,"(through chuckling) Yeah, I think I should have the right to hold the gun! (runs up to Shadow)"
Shadow,(runs to Sonic) I think so too!
Shadow,Man...
Sonic,Hey. (starts laughing halfway through) Remember that one time I said I should have the right to hold the gun?
Shadow,I remember when you said you had the right to hold a gun.
Sonic,"Long time no see, buddy! So, you wanna go find a gun together?"
Shadow,"No, the gun's mine, and mine alone."
The Devil,"Shadow, Shadow, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Sonic,What the hell? Who's this guy?
The Devil,"Yet again, it seems like you have uh, confused legality and sin- Okay, so I'm gonna have to break down the myth of Americana and the uh... the- the... You know what, figure it out yourself! (floats away) I shouldn't explain everything to you."
Sonic,"He, like, just straight up didn't have time to do that. It seems like he really wanted to get into something there. Come with me."
The Devil,"(Doom's Eye turns towards them) Hey, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay! You look, I said you're gonna have figure this out for yourself."
Shadow,"All presidents are clearly evil. They're war crime committing bastards, and I want to become one of them."
The Devil,"Yes, good, I like where your head's at. But I feel like you'll do too good."
Shadow,"Too good at being president? Isn't that good for you, though? I mean, I'm trying to do it by electoralism so I can give people the illusion that there's a choice."
The Devil,"Man, I don't know, that's a little complicated, even for me. The point is just go out and, like, piss on a grave of someone who was a good person."
The Devil,"Here, fight this. This guy- this guy donates to charities. I summoned him fro- from heaven. (Penny loses it) Kill him real quick, and then we'll feel good about-"
Black Bull,I'm the- I'm the charity man!
The Devil,Oh my god.
Sonic,"Whoa! Long time no see, buddy!"
The Devil,Black Bull.
Shadow,"Hmm, Bam-a-lam!"
The Devil,Kill him.
Shadow,(yelling battle cries while attacking Black Bull)
Sonic,"Wait, okay, hold on. I'm kind of struggling with what exactly... it is we're doing here."
Shadow,We're shooting the Black Bull!
Sonic,He said this guy donates to ch- Whoa!
Shadow,"I can stop time, as well! Holy crap, I did a lot of damage with my GUN!"
Black Bull,"(yells in pain) Oh, geez! Come on, man! Why you killing so much? (dies)"
Shadow,Goodbye! I got the piss diamond!
Sonic,Yeah!
Shadow,(walks while singing wordlessly and holding two Chaos Emeralds)
The Devil,"Hey, that was pretty good, you got 16 sin points! So that's about 16 feet under ground, you're gonna have to keep going."
Shadow,"What is this, The Good Place? Come on, just tell me that I can be king of hell already."
The Devil,"I'm not- no, you gotta earn that! Okay, first of all-"
Shadow,Why am I moving backwards when I walk?
The Devil,"I'm the king of hell. That's not gonna change, you fucking weird little rat thing. Second of all, hey, second of all- (Shadow continues walking away) Would you look at me when I'm talking to you?"
Shadow,"(stops walking, turns around) No, I'm disrespecting you."
The Devil,"Tha- Well, that's just mean! That's kind of, like, antithetical, 'cause I'm the one you're trying- if you're disrespecting the devil, then, like..."
Shadow,Die.
The Devil,"Wh- look, we're trying to figure out ethics here from a moral standpoint. It's difficult, you're making me think about this way more than I ever have. Come with me!"
The Devil,Welcome to rat zone.
Shadow,"Urgh! Oh God, rats! I love rats."
Shadow,(flashback) ...hot sauce on everything.
Shadow,(present) Why did my brain go-
Eggman,"(flashback) Red stripes, jet boots!"
Shadow,"Wait, I have jet boots! That's badass! I should use them more often. (rat squeak) I think I heard... a rat. I'm gonna go give him a hug."
Shadow,"Are you up here, rat?"
Shadow,"What the fuck? (voice cast laughing) (gasps) Back handspring! (does a backflip) Huh? (sees 13 clones) Ooh, a clone of myself!"
Shadow Clones,"Ooh, a clone of myself!"
Shadow,"Oh, this leads to so many questions."
Eggman,"(appears in his Egg Mobile) Oh, a clone of yourself, isn't that pretty cool? I made all of these because I want them to take over Apple."
Shadow,"That's cool, I suppose. (voice cast laughs again) Can I have one for... personal reasons? Not what you think, though! Sicko! (sighs) He thinks I'm a pervert now. (voice cast laughs again)"
Eggman,(flashback) HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING ABOUT MY FUCKING DICK AGAIN??! OH MY GOD. WHEN I SEE YOU! IT'S ON. SIGHT. Shut the fuck up. Shut the FUCK up. Everybody's fucked my wife!
Shadow,"Wait! It's not because of the clone thing! It's because I pissed on his wife that he thinks I'm a pervert! I remember that! Do you remember that, ...Other Shadow?"
Shadow Clones,"Ooh, a clone of myself!"
Shadow,"Okay, I'm not really liking these clones anymore. All they do is say a clone of myself, which is weird. (Mar laughs)"
Eggman,"Oh, Jesus Christ."
Egg Pawn,"What are you watching, sir?"
Eggman,"It's the Incredible Hulk movie. I don't know, like, what happened. There's demons and they've ruined everything in the 2022-"
Egg Pawn,This movie really fuckin' sucks.
Eggman,This- the 2022 release is so shitty.
Egg Pawn,"You gotta get a new movie for movie night, please."
Eggman,"Oh my God, my mustache looks like fucking grass. Please get me some more mustache cream immediately!"
Egg Pawn,"(all Egg Pawns run out of the room) Okay, yes, sir! More mustache!"
Shadow,"(groaning) So bad... CG abomination... ruined... (gets up) these images in my head... Oh well, time to go to this ancient Aztec temple, with a loop-de-loop in it."
The Devil,"Ah, bing-bong, hey, what's up, you're doing a bad job."
Shadow,I know I'm doing a bad job!
The Devil,"Yeah, okay, so self... like... fucking adultery, people often get that... li- like, they think it's sinful. That's kind of like Christian ideology, I don't really agree with that. You're still sitting at 16 sin points for killing Black Bull. I really need you to up the ante, bud. I want you down in hell, I want you to be a middle manager. We can really do great- (notices Eggman's fleet ahead) What the- what the fuck is that? Do you see that? Is that... King Koopa What the fuck is that?"
Shadow,"Uh, Close, it's Eggman."
The Devil,"Oh, okay. From Sonic?"
Shadow,"Yeah, from Sonic."
The Devil,"Oh, okay. I know where we are."
Shadow,From So- (gasps)
Eggman,(through speakers) I'm gonna be the king of sin! It'll be me!
The Devil,"He's got a lot of sin points, dude. You're gonna have to catch up. Bye! (Penny laughing)"
Shadow,Fuck!
Omega,"I'm here now. I guess we're going to get your sin points up. First, get me an edible."
Shadow,Did you teleport me from the Aztec place to here?
Omega,"No, we walked. What are you talking about?"
Eggman,You stupid bitches. (laughs evilly) You really thought you were gonna get more sin points than me? Do you know how many people have been killed?
Omega,(ready to fight) Hey!
Shadow,"(stopping Omega) Well, you know what they say: if you kill someone, you get all of their sin points."
Eggman,"Yeah, duh, you idiot! That's what I just said!"
Shadow,"Yeah, so I'm gonna kill you."
Eggman,You're fu- what? Wait a minute. I don't- I don't wanna die yet. Wait.
Omega,Engaging sin-sucking mode. (voice cast laughs)
Eggman,"I'm gonna cru- I'm gonna crack you wide open, you're dead!"
Shadow,"All right, Omega, be ready to suck the sin out this boy!"
Omega,Engaging suck apparatus.
Eggman,(groans)
Shadow,(sighs) Looks like we're in hell.
Eggman,That's right. Now we're gonna battle in hell! (voice cast laughs hard) I have my Hell Spider. Do y- do you see these people on the screen? These are all the people I've killed!
Omega,Give us the rest of your sin.
Shadow,This is the coolest fucking moment of my afterlife! I'm not gonna let you ruin it with your stupid egg-shaped dick!
Eggman,"Listen to me! I am in no relationship, I am neither single or taken! I am a gamer and I am in hell! Do you understand me? I rule this land!"
Eggman,"Welcome to the casino, bitches! I want big slots, big numbers, big numbers, big numbers! Heh, if you live in Baltimore, fuck you!"
Omega,What do we win?
Shadow,"Of course! The ultimate evil in the world, gambling!"
Eggman,Gambling!
Eggman,Bombs?
Omega,I don't want that.
Eggman,"Here, they're yours, my friend! Wait-"
Eggman,"(coughs) Here, hold the- WHOA!"
Mar,"Oh, my God!"
Chase,Bro sat on his own nuts!
Rouge,So platforming on gun rights clearly didn't work out.
Omega,"Hold on. What's behind us? Uh- beep boop, gonna push out my eyes."
Rouge,"I mean, I think it's nothing! I think we're mostly looking forward, here!"
Eggman,"Well, if it isn't Rouge the Bat, Shadow the Hedgehog-"
Eggman,"I'm gonna roll big numbers, baby. I'm playing at the poker table! I just lost $300,000, but it's okay 'cause I won $700. Please don't form a gambling addiction. Don't be like me. (voice cast wheezes) It's over for me."
Shadow,And now it is over for you. (reaches the Red Chaos Emerald)
Omega,We've acquired the sin of gambling.
Shadow,"Any last words, Robotnik? (other Emeralds float around him)"
Eggman,(burps) I'm dying. (voice cast laughs) It all hurts. Oh god-
Shadow,"Not the best choice of last words- (Omega interupts) Oh, I'm sorry?"
Omega,Can I have the green one when you're done?
Shadow,"Of course you can, Omega."
Omega,Sweeeeet.
Eggman,"Shadow, the power, it's too- you can't rule over hell; you're not strong enough! That's why I built those robots!"
Shadow,"Oh yeah? Well, watch this. I'm gonna do it anyway, and then you'll be all like... (silence) because you'll be dead. (voice cast laughs)"
Omega,You tell him.
Shadow,"And then, you'll get to hell, and look up, and you wanna know what you'll see? My heels in your face."
Omega,"Get he ass, you're getting roasted. Absolutely blasted. Destroyed."
Eggman,You don't even know...
Eggman,AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Shadow,"Every day feels the same. (voice cast laughs, the newspaper flies and lands on his leg again.) I wake up, I brood, I see the Fire in the Sky Festival, I think about her-"
The Devil,"♫Ding-a-ling, cocksucker!♫ Okay, you can't do that to hell and get away with it. I had to roll back time. Do you know how much of a fucking logistical issue it is when you destroy hell? That's my house, dude! What the fuck were you thinking?"
Shadow,"Oh, I'm sorry, are you mad? Are you big mad? Are you angy?"
The Devil,"Yes, I am! Can you not tell by my tone of voice? I need you to get sin points, but do it without fucking over my- okay, you know what? Fuck you, you're going to space!"
Shadow,Hm...
The Devil,(appears behind Shadow) Maybe you could do some interstellar crime space... sin shit.
Shadow,(turns head around to The Devil) What's a crime in space?
The Devil,"You just turned your head around like 360 degrees like an owl that was fucking cool! That scared the shit outta me, don't do that again."
The Devil,"Uh.. Go fuck that thing up, all right? Eggman, you can- you can accrue uh.. sin points from Eggman without directly killing him."
Shadow,That sounds like a weird loophole-
The Devil,"Hey look, it's you."
Shadow,"Hold on, Maria."
Maria,"Oh, my God! What's that?"
Heavy Dog Pilot,"You gotta stop- we're gonna stop Shadow from uh.. being... super fucking evil, get all the points, 'cause we gotta kill him right now."
Maria,Evil? What is this man talking about?
Heavy Dog Pilot,Stop!
Maria,You've been nothing but a kind soul since I've known you.
Maria,"Remember when I died, and you saved me? Remember?"
Shadow,"(present) Maria, you don't know about my sin total."
The Devil,"♫Wee-oo, wee-oo♫. Hey, I'm in your flashbacks now. It turns out you didn't save her, you did a very bad job. That's embarrassing for you, buddy."
Shadow,"Wait, were you Maria?!"
The Devil,"What? No, I'm the devil. Heavy Dog! (Penny laughs)"
Heavy Dog Pilot,"Hey, welcome to the Heavy Dog! Hey, don't destroy- you know this thing costs, like, millions of dollars, you know?"
Shadow,"You wanna know how much I cost? 69 cents, baby!"
Maria,"Shadow, that's a dog! Why are you killing that? No!"
Heavy Dog Pilot,"Oh, my God! Well, what's another hundred billion dollars off the US government, you know?"
The Devil,"That was kickass, dude!"
The Devil,"Okay, that was, like, awesome. Not a sin. You did just waste military money, which is super funny. Uh, you're really, really bad at this."
Shadow,Your standards are so fucked!
The Devil,"Are you sure you're evil? 'Cause, like, I'm pretty sure you're gonna go to heaven at this rate, bucko. That's, like, impressive. I know my friend, Jeezy C up there, He would love you. Uh, I'm kind of running out of ideas, bucko, I- I don't even know that that many sins exist. Um, let me think. You could get a j- internship at Disney."
Shadow,Disney?
The Devil,"Yeah. They made Beauty and the Beast, you ever seen that movie? It's pretty good. (sniffs)"
Shadow,The remake or the original?
The Devil,"Are you talking about Belle, the anime? It wasn't really a remake, it was more of an interpretation..."
Shadow,"No, th- the live action one!"
The Devil,"...to tell a different story. I- I'm getting kinda getting carried away. Uh, There's a lot of sin in this world. I'm sure-"
The Devil,What- is that an alien?
Shadow,They're loyal to me.
The Devil,"That's kickass, dude! All right, I'm excited to see where this goes, then!"
Shadow,And I'm gonna use them to take over hell.
The Devil,"Okay, don't do that."
President,You come in here with a tier-two and tier-three sub... right next to you? Goodbye.
Preisdent,Do you see what's happening outside? Do you see this phone in front of me? I hate him. The parasocial relationship that he's built.
President,I don't want them to call me! I want the world to end!
The Devil,"Ah, that was great. Thanks for going to Chuck E. Cheese with me. I kinda forgot the whole sin thing, but, you know, we got a bunch of tickets, I got some sticky hands. Remember that big gun in the sky? That was crazy, right?"
Shadow,Didn't it blow up the White House?
The Devil,That was so funny.
Shadow,Aren't we standing next to the White Ho- (Shadow screaming)
Shadow,"(sighs) Every day feels the same. I make the same god damn joke, I get blown up."
The Devil,"Hey, tricked ya!"
Rouge,"You know, Eggman just pays me not to blow up his robots. You could get in on this."
Shadow,"Maybe, but I need to become president."
Rouge,A protection racket is a surefire way to become president.
Shadow,"Good thoughts, Rouge, you're hired."
Shadow,He really let himself go since the last time we saw him.
Rouge,"I mean, none of us are. Look at us, we're cartoon talking animals."
Rouge,"Look, there's a whole room full of cartoon talking animals over here."
Clones,A clone of myself! A clone of myself! A clone of myself! A clone of myself!
Rouge,"Hey, Omega, is this normal?"
Rouge,"Oh, fuck, we gotta go to a doctor right now! Do you know, like, 3000 doctors we could get here?"
Rouge,"All right, well, nothing to it. Let's blow 'em all up."
Shadow,I keep remembering my presidential run back in the election year of 1907.
The Devil,"Hi, Shadow! It's me, the Devil!"
The Devil,I love you!
The Devil,I'm having so much fun with you!
Shadow,"Thank you, I suppose?"
Shadow,"Wait, one, two, three, four, five... Where... Where's that fricking sixth chaos emerald?"
Shadow,Is it up there? This is a nice place.
Shadow,"Well, them's the breaks, pal. Them's the breaks."
Sonic,"Shadow, you're an asshole, man."
Shadow,"You are what you eat, Sonic."
Sonic,"What the- What the hell, man?"
Sonic,"Oh, my God! That was kind of sick!"
Shadow,"Thanks, I worked hard on it."
The Devil,"This is the last time I fuckin' play around with mortals. You guys are all fuckin' mean, earthly desires and all that shit. You think I care about being president of hell? No, it's just my job, it's what I do. I rule over Tartarus with an iron black fist. It was awesome until I decided to have fun!"
Shadow,"Wait, are you telling me you're upset that humans sin? What the fuck is wrong with you? You suck as the devil! This is why I'm gonna usurp you one day! Maybe. If I decide that. I don't know, I've lost control of my life."
The Devil,Usurp these nuts.
Shadow,"At last, they're all here. nSo, king of hell, president, I have all this power at my fingertips."
The Devil,Hey! What's up?
The Devil,It's me!
Shadow,Stoooop!
The Devil,I don't know how to impress upon you that physical damage done to my body does not affect me in the long term.
Sonic,Shadow!
The Devil,"Oh, your friends are here!"
Sonic,"We're here to help you, man! With what, I don't know, but I value our friendship!"
Eggman,"Jesus Christ, watch out for that son of a bitch!"
The Devil,"It's really cute that you're gonna defeat me with the power of friendship and all, but again, I am the devil from the Bible, so I don't know how well it's gonna work."
Sonic,"You motherfucker, you didn't let me finish!"
The Devil,"Uh-huh, go ahead."
Shadow,I have all this power in my hands-
The Devil,"Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up. I'm the de- I don't care! I do not care! You don't understand, I came down here as a joke to have fun! This is not- This means nothing to me! This means nothing to me, all right? You mean nothing to me! You and your little friends are fuckin' annoying! This is why I stay down in hell, this is why I punish sinners! I'm the good guy! Do you realize? I am the good guy here! I am the winner of everything! God goes up and he plays with all his little friends like, Oh look, he donated to charity, yeah, whatever, fuckin'- (babbles gibberish)"
Shadow,(grunting)
The Devil,"I get to kill people! I get to poke people with hot sticks all day! It's great, gimme those! You don't get those, you lost your stupid little privileges! Fuck you! Dipshit!"
Eggman,"Oh, God!"
The Devil,Go to space!
The Devil,"Look, I can do this! I can do this any time I want! This is nothing to me! You are nothing to me! I hate you! I hate you! This is my big fucking thing!"
Sonic,"Oh my God, he's fucking losing it entirely!"
The Devil,"Why don't you answer my chats in your chat box? I have the sub badge, 12 months. You never acknowledged me, not even once. And I came here from hell to have fun with you! I'm your biggest fan! I've been with you since day one! I got first badge, I was your first subscriber! And you don't pay attention to me! I was with you through your candidacy, I was with you through your sin points, we went to Chuck E. Cheese, you got me the little parachuting trooper boy, and yet you won't acknowledge me! You still just leave me in the dust every single day!"
The Devil,"So this guy, in 50 years, he's gonna be the best streamer in the world and he's gonna be my friend, you said?"
Gerald,"I created Shadow, really, just to roast you. To call you all sorts of things and usurp your power. You were never strong. All right, I'm going to end stream now."
The Devil,"So all of this, this was a big prank?"
Gerald,"That's right, it was all a joke. I don't know how I'm talking to you in real time, [Penny laughs] but just pretend that I'm not actually here. I'm speaking to you from the past. [to Shadow] Shadow, get up and call him a dumbass motherfucker, all right? Promise me this."
Maria,Wait! I think you should call him a bitch-ass motherfucker!
The Devil,"Don't call me that, all right? Don't call me that. Don't call me that, all right? Listen to me, dude. I've been in your chat since day one. You don't wanna hurt my feelings, right? I'm loyal! I follow you on Twitter! Your side account and your main! I even follow your after dark Twitter! You can't do this to me, please! It's me, your friend!"
Shadow,"I want to hurt your feelings so badly. You have no idea, Satan. Lucifer. Can I call you Lucy? I will anyway, whether you like it or not."
The Devil,"Hey, hey, hey don't come any closer! (he stammers in fear) Don't, no!"
Shadow,Bitch!
Dispatcher,"(intercom) Alright, it looks like we got Sonic finally."
Dispatcher,"(intercom) He's been really hard to catch because he's so fast, but fortunately, we have him in this enclosed space."
Sonic,(muffled) I'm gonna kill all of you!
Dispatcher,"(intercom) Yep, we've heard that one before."
Dispatcher,"(intercom) Anyway, so- oh wait..."
Sonic,(muffled) I'm bustin' out now! I'm actively busting out the prison.
Dispatcher,"(intercom) Oh god, he's actually doing it."
Sonic,I'm now outside of the prison bars! Here I go!
Dispatcher,"(intercom) You're a fugitive to law, Sonic."
Sonic,Blam! I told you! (grabs onto missile holster of helicopter) I was gonna break free!
Dispatcher,"(intercom) You son of a bitch, Sonic."
Sonic,"Live and Learn, everybody. That's what I'm talking about!"
Sonic,Talk about a low budget flight! No food or movies? I'm- (Big peeks out of the doorway) Big?! What are you doing here?
Dispatcher,(intercom) He's also being brought into custody.
Sonic,You need to go back home. (Sonic jumps off of the plane with his skateboard that just appeared) I have a suspicion you left the oven oooooooooooooonnnnnn!
Sonic,Woooooooooooooo!
Hayley,That's a cool JPEG.
Sonic,Huh?!
Shadow,Hey.
Sonic,Wh- what's that?
Shadow,Do you know where the nearest Hot Topic is?! Za Warudo!
Sonic,"Hey, you put that down. That's an expensive diamond!"
Shadow,"Diamonds aren't green, dick-nips."
Sonic,"That's really rude, I'm gonna have to call the polices on you!"
Shadow,Za Warudo!
Sonic,(off-screen) I'll make you eat those words! (breaking into laughter with the rest of the cast)
Sonic,Wha--?
Shadow,"See ya, nerd."
Sonic,Huh?!
Sonic,He's faster than Sonic! He's faster than Sonic! What?
Sonic,It's almost like that.. emerald has some sort of power!
Shadow,This emerald has all sorts of power. Za Warudo!
Sonic,Stop saying that.
Rouge,We meet at at last!
Knuckles,"We met last week, what are you talking about? You've been hittin' the reefers."
Knuckles,AGH!
Eggman,"That's right, Sonic! I'm taki- oh-- oh, I mean-- Oh wait, Sonic isnt here. Knuckles, I'm taking your Emeralds!"
Knuckles,"That's fine, I didn't really want it anyway."
Rouge,"Hey, those are mine, bring 'em back!"
Eggman,"No, fuck you. I'm takin' it away, you...thot ass. Bitch, I could--"
Knuckles,"Ugh, now I'm mad! Ahhhhhh! I can't--"
Eggman,OH! MY EMERALDS! OHH!! AGHH!
Rouge,That's what you get for being a dumb- dumb piece of shit!
Knuckles,"Sorry, I wasn't trying to touch you! Nerd!"
Rouge,"Yeah, you were!"
Knuckles,Get out of my face-
Rouge,Pervert!
Knuckles,I just punched an emerald! Hurt really bad.
Eggman,"I'm gonna kill these sons of bitches, RAH."
Rouge,I can't believe you did this. This is all your fault.
Knuckles,I can't believe your tits are one polygon!
Tails,"I'm flying this plane all by myself, I'm literally five years old. I'm not in any way qualified to do this."
Eggman,[snickers evilly as he approaches her in his Eggwalker]
Amy,Where's my mom?
Tails,"Hey, what are you doing down there? She's looks like she's all by herself. Maybe I should go pick her up in my super cool airplane."
Eggman,What the actual shit. Where did Amy GO? SHE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!
Tails,"Eggman, come over here!"
Eggman,"I'M GOING TO-- ARRRRGH, MY BONES!! Augh, I know I should've-- [coughs loudly]"
Eggman,WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
Tails,Happy April Fools!
Eggman,"OH, MY GOD! That's it, I'm calling the police! 911, I'm the detec--"
Tails,I AM THE POLICE! [Defeats Eggman]
Eggman,[Long vomit-like grunt of death]
Eggman,[sigh]
Amy,Are you my mom?
Tails,"Uh, hey Amy, I'm great. Do you want to come get in my supercool airplane?"
Amy,No! Not at all. It looks really gross.
Blue,Aww! (reacting to Tails shrugging at Amy's answer)
Amy,"Wait, on second thought, I don't wanna be here."
Tails,"No, it's too late. You already made up your mind, I'm out of here!"
Amy,Wait come back! I changed my mind!
Sonic,Oh... I'm in jail again! I just-- Amy!?
Amy,Hey! I found you!
Sonic,"No! No, I told you once too many-- Ohh, I'm so mad at you! One too many times is enough!"
Amy,One too many times is not enough!
Sonic,Hey! You stop it right now. You're trying to trick me with your vixen tricks? I won't take any card. I can get out by myself.
Amy,"Alright, bye! Have good times in prison."
Shadow,"That blue hedgehog again, of all places."
Sonic,"(talking over Shadow) Hey, that's..."
Sonic,I've... f-found you... faker!
Shadow,Faker? I think you're the fake hedgehog around here.
Sonic,I'll make you eat those words!
Shadow,Perish.
Hayley,"(deadpan) Shadow. [reading the on-screen text, signalling the start of Sonic and Shadow's first battle]"
Shadow,"Yes, thank you, voice."
Shadow,Let me just spit it out!
Sonic,"Thanks, I forgot who this was!"
Shadow,No. Nice to meet you. I'm Shadow. Ow.
Sonic,Sorry for hitting you so much. It's just... it's part of the narrative. Wham!
Shadow,Ouch!
Sonic,Ow!
Shadow,"I got you, you stupid blue fool."
Sonic,(over Shadow's speaking) Ow!
Sonic,It seems as if we're evenly matched in some kind of way!
Shadow,OW! We aren't. You just killed me.
Sonic,Just kidding! I'm better than you! I'm better than everyone!
Shadow,But... I'm the ultimate lifeform...
Eggman,(over a walkie-talkie) It would seem that you bitches have come to a standstill in Tarzan's forest.
Sonic,Hot Topic!?
Shadow,No! My secret!
Ryan,"Alfred, I hope you know that is actually what happens in the story."
Penny,"That is act-- like, he literally was like-"
Alfred,"Wait, dead seriously? Seriously?!"
Ryan,He literally says this island will explode--
Penny,"Yeah, see? Watch!"
Alfred,"OH MY GOD, I DIDN'T KNOW!!"
Knuckles,"And so I said, What are you, smoking the reefer again? Hahaha, classic. Ahh, I enjoy our talks."
Eggman,"(on a live broadcast on every TV screen in the city) Hehehe! Hey, everyone! Guess what?"
Ugly Little Girl,Mommy...?
Eggman,"And your STUPID NOSE! I'm taking everything from you, GIVE me your phone."
Civilian,"Oh my God, it missed!"
Eggman,"Fuck you, Moon! You never had the cheese I wanted!"
Civilian,Oh. Well that wasn't very nice.
Eggman,"I hope you're ready to die, It's gonna be like Evangelion. Get the fuck out."
Sonic,Whoa...
Amy,"That is like, Evangelion or some shit man, that is crazy. Anyway."
Sonic,"I just- n'ohhh. I always didn't like the Moon, but--"
Tails,"No, I loved the Moon! I don't know why he felt like he needed to blow it up."
Sonic,"Well, maybe it like said something weird about his mom or something. I don't know. I can't put my finger on it."
Tails,"Well, here! Take this... diamond as a consolation prize."
Sonic,"Wait a minute, I have an epiphany!"
Amy,"Wait, what's-"
Tails,Let's go!
Amy,What's an epiphany?
Amy,So I said... Why the long face?
Tails,That's not- That's not very funny Amy honestly you probably should like pick-
Amy,Ohhh. You mean I should marry a very handsome and wealthy man who has stock in the diamond and ring business?
Knuckles,"Hey, what's up good-looking? Also, hi Amy."
Tails,"Can you guys like, stop having relationship issues while I'm on the phone with my dentist?"
Knuckles,Agh!
Secretary,"Mr. President, you have a dentist appointment at 7:00."
President,[exasperated sigh]
President,Mmmm... That's my favorite song!
Eggman,I'm takin' over the universe! I'm takin' over yo' world! I'm takin' yo' TV! I'm GLITCHIN' it!
President,Crackin' Eggs?
Sonic,"Hi, Mr. President. We need your help!"
President,[gasp]
President,"(talking over Sonic) Sonic, my long-lost lover! It's fi-- oh--"
Sonic,"Wha-- Hey. I told you not to bring that up anymore. I'm putting that behind me, Mr. President."
Tails,"Sonic I found this, like, used copy of Sims 4!"
Sonic,"What?! That's the least best Sims game! But I'll take it anyway, come on let's go!"
Tails,Wait for meeeee!
President,"Wait, wait! Come back! Honeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyy (turns vomit-like in the end)"
Knuckles,How the fuck did we get to Egypt!?
Sonic,"It's a big triangle or something, I don't know. What's on the top there?"
Knuckles,"I don't know, but I'm gonna punch it. That's... what I do."
Sonic,"Hey, don't be so mean to Amy, okay? She's literally just standing there."
Knuckles,(over Sonic) No!
Tails,"Alright, I've got my jet! Let's go!"
Sonic,We don't have a jet.
Sonic,I'm gonna go in there first and you guys back me up okay?
Tails,Nope. I'm going.
Sonic,Do you guys hear me? Do you- hey!
Tails,I'm just trying to get a feel for this door. I think it's made-
Sonic,"It's made of wood, Tails, there's nothing else to get a feel of. It's wood and paint."
Knuckles,Uh actually it's a really low-res JPEG.
Sonic,What? A J- What's a JPEG? Stop speaking witch.
Eggman,"Heyy, bitcheeeees~. Didn't expect to see me."
Sonic,"Hey, what's going on Eggman? Some weird guy named the Glitch is-"
Eggman,"Sonic, I've had enough. You took my wife. You fucked my crops. I'm taking ya life."
Alfred,(reminding us he is blind to this game) WHAT?! WHAT?! WH-- WHY IS NASA THERE!? I'M SO CONFUSED!
Sonic,I gotta get on that plane!
Knuckles,"Oh, no! It's an ancient Egyptian space shuttle!"
Alfred,"Can I just real quick say that I never got to play this game, and everything that's happening is new to me and my mind can't... connect right now."
Hayley,"No, it's fine. Don't worry."
Blue,"[laughing] I'm in the same boat, I have no fucking clue what's happening."
Sonic,Did someone drop the emeralds again?
Knuckles,"It wasn't me, I swear!"
Tails,"Hey Sonic, I have a question. Since I'm literally five, can you please explain to me how you fucked crops?"
Sonic,"I did not-- I didn't wanna have to explain that to you Tails, I didn't wanna! You forced my hand."
Tails,PLEASE...!
Sonic,"Now you're scarred for life, and I'm gonna have to take you to therapy, and it's just-"
Tails,Yeah I think I need to melt now.
Amy,"After you explained how to fuck plants, I think I'm a veggie."
Tails,"I didn't expect that to be exactly how you explained it,"
Amy,"Well, it's a personal choice and I thank you not to judge me for it."
Sonic,"Amy, shut up right now. Shut your mouth, right now. We are not opening up that can of worms. Okay."
Tails,"Okay, I think I found him. He looks like he's uhhh... somewhere inside-- some-- there's a flashing pink thing. I don't really know."
Amy,We need to find our way down the thermal coils to the nuclear reactor.
Tails,"I-- Okay, but I really just want to hold on to this very shiny object, it's really pretty."
Amy,"Oooooh, shiny~!"
Tails,I was thinking I was gonna give it to my mom for her birthday.
Sonic,At least we found some use for this piss rock.
Sonic,I'm out of here. See you later!
Sonic,"So wait, I had to put the what in the what now?"
Tails,(over walkie-talkie) You have to put it in the nuclear reactor!
Sonic,Huh? What!?
Knuckles,"Ah, I see we meet again. For the first last time."
Rouge,But this time we're in space. I don't know how the fuck I got here to be honest with you.
Knuckles,I don't know how the fuck I'm breathing to be honest. AGH!
Rouge,"So, do you want to like, go get coffee later?"
Knuckles,They're my favorite polygon!
Rouge,[Anguished screaming]
Knuckles,Noooo!
Knuckles,(after saving Rouge by grabbing her hand) I did it!
Rouge,Knuckles.
Knuckles,"I'm sorry, did you not consent to me saving your life?!"
Rouge,"No, I did. I just-"
Big,[appears and makes a distracting noise]
Knuckles,I'll push you back down!
Rouge,"(over Knuckles' sarcastic apology) No, listen!"
Knuckles,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that."
Rouge,"You're not listening to me! I wanted to say, I'm sorry for the way that I've acted and--"
Knuckles,"Whoa! Big, what are you doing back there, dude?!"
Big,"Uh, nothing! Uh, don't even look at me, I--"
Rouge,"Who are you talking to? Never mind, it doesn't matter, I'm super high right now."
Rouge,Yeah. Weed. Just for you.
Sonic,"That's right, everybody. It's your favorite boi."
Eggman,"(in a shaky voice, possibly from insanity) Get the fuck out or I'm gonna shoot Amy in the fucking face!"
Sonic,No!
Eggman,"I swear to GOD, I'll DO IT, you BITCH!! GET OUT!! I will pop her."
Amy,Don't give him my life for a piss rock!
Sonic,Will you pop this piss rock?
Eggman,[gasp]
Amy,(off-screen) Sonic!!
Eggman,"(in a deeper voice) You thought you were gonna escape, and I knew you were gonna fart in here, so I had to put up a fucking seal."
Sonic,WOAHHHH!!!
Amy,Noooo!
Tails,Sonic!
Sonic,Talk about a low-budget flight.
Tails,"Shoot me you fucking coward, DO IT."
Tails,You won't!
Eggman,"I'm going to make sure that you watch my Vine compilations and I'm gonna make you perish, you little rodent!"
Tails,I will never watch your Vine compilations 'cuz they suck. You pick all the bad Vines!
Amy,I'm just gonna hang out in the corner here and watch. J-Just don't shoot me!
Eggman,My Funyun® rings! I'm taking them back!
Tails,Gimme those Funyuns!
Eggman,Give them back to me!
Tails,OMNOMNOMNOMNOM!
Eggman,I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!
Tails,"They're my Funyuns now, Eggman."
Eggman,"Tails, listen to me. I know who your mother is... [coughing in defeat]"
Tails,Don't you fucking lie to me!!
Knuckles,Am I in Halo?
A voice,Oooooh...
The voice,Knuckles... here's your bitch back. (echoing)
Knuckles,"...Thanks, Jesus!"
Sonic,"One bitch, fresh off the presses! Wassup, Knuckles? Piss rock saved me. And now I'm all dizzy."
Knuckles,I'm- I'm too high for this shit. I can't. I can't.
Sonic,"Oh, God, please."
Knuckles,(holding Sonic on his shoulders from being high) Are you... limber?
Sonic,"No, I'm like a high equivalent. Anyway,"
Knuckles,What?
Sonic,"So uh, what's going on with Eggman? What'd he do, did he make everybody watch the Splatoon Let's Plays or somethin'?"
Knuckles,"Everybody at home, are you getting this right now?"
Sonic,"Hey, this looks really d- delicious. I feel like I could eat this."
Knuckles,Sonic! No! You're joking--
Sonic,...not gonna do that!
Knuckles,Whatever.
Hayley,W-W-W-W-W-W-Welcome to the Fun Land!
Sonic,(noticing Shadow) Oh.
Shadow,"Welcome to Fun Land, Sonic."
Sonic,Oh sweet! Is there a cartw- wait. Ferris wheel is what I meant.
Shadow,"Oh, you know I have, Sonic. You know I've seen my fair share of piss rocks. Now let's start running."
Sonic,(talking over Shadow) You said that really sensually!
Shadow,"Yes. I'm a very sensual being, a hopeless romantic if you will."
Sonic,"What ya see is what ya get, just a guy who loves piss rocks!"
Shadow,What the fuck?
Sonic,I'm gonna get faster than youuu!
Shadow,"No, I'm faster than you actually. I did the math, I'm pretty fast."
Sonic,"(talking over Shadow) No, I'm faster than you! It's part of my name! Sonic-"
Shadow,"(talking over Sonic) See look, I'm faster- Ow."
Sonic,Sonic Fast-Man Hedghog.
Shadow,"(over Shadow) Ok, first of all, rude. This is still just like Dragon Ball Z."
Sonic,"(repeatedly using his Homing Attack on Shadow) Bam bam bam bam bam bam, you know how it goes, you know how it goes."
Shadow,"Yes, this is... (indiscernable)"
Sonic,"Uh, just like Dragon Ball Z, did you ever watch that one episode of Dragon Ball Super where..."
Sonic,"And then I said, Hey! Give me back my lettuce!"
Shadow,"What kind of list was it? Is it the Naughty-Nice List, you Santa mofo?"
Sonic,"No, I said lettuce."
Shadow,Ahhh!!
Sonic,Were you even listening at all?
Sonic,(holding onto a wire) Shoulda taken dayquil!
